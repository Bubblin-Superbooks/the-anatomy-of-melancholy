<h4>DEMOCRITUS JUNIOR.</h4>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE LAST LONDON EDITION.</p>
<p>The work now restored to public notice has had an extraordinary fate. At the time of its original publication it obtained a great celebrity, which continued more than half a century. During that period few books were more read, or more deservedly applauded. It was the delight of the learned, the solace of the indolent, and the refuge of the uninformed. It passed through at least eight editions, by which the bookseller, as WOOD records, got an estate; and, notwithstanding the objection sometimes opposed against it, of a quaint style, and too great an accumulation of authorities, the fascination of its wit, fancy, and sterling sense, have borne down all censures, and extorted praise from the first Writers in the English language. The grave JOHNSON has praised it in the warmest terms, and the ludicrous STERNE has interwoven many parts of it into his own popular performance. MILTON did not disdain to build two of his finest poems on it; and a host of inferior writers have embellished their works with beauties not their own, culled from a performance which they had not the justice even to mention. Change of times, and the frivolity of fashion, suspended, in some degree, that fame which had lasted near a century; and the succeeding generation affected indifference towards an author, who at length was only looked into by the plunderers of literature, the poachers in obscure volumes. The plagiarisms of Tristram Shandy, so successfully brought to light by DR. FERRIAR, at length drew the attention of the public towards a writer, who, though then little known, might, without impeachment of modesty, lay claim to every mark of respect; and inquiry proved, beyond a doubt, that the calls of justice had been little attended to by others, as well as the facetious YORICK. WOOD observed, more than a century ago, that several authors had unmercifully stolen matter from BURTON without any acknowledgment. The time, however, at length arrived, when the merits of the Anatomy of Melancholy were to receive their due praise. The book was again sought for and read, and again it became an applauded performance. Its excellencies once more stood confessed, in the increased price which every copy offered for sale produced; and the increased demand pointed out the necessity of a new edition. This is now presented to the public in a manner not disgraceful to the memory of the author; and the publisher relies with confidence, that so valuable a repository of amusement and information will continue to hold the rank to which it has been restored, firmly supported by its own merit, and safe from the influence and blight of any future caprices of fashion. To open its valuable mysteries to those who have not had the advantage of a classical education, translations of the countless quotations from ancient writers which occur in the work, are now for the first time given, and obsolete orthography is in all instances modernized.</p>

<h3>ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR.</h3>
<p>Robert Burton was the son of Ralph Burton, of an ancient and genteel family at Lindley, in Leicestershire, and was born there on the 8th of February 1576.  from whence he was, at the age of seventeen, in the long vacation, 1593, sent to Brazen Nose College, in the condition of a commoner, where he made considerable progress in logic and philosophy. In 1599 he was elected student of Christ Church, and, for form&#39;s sake, was put under the tuition of Dr. John Bancroft, afterwards Bishop of Oxford. In 1614 he was admitted to the reading of the Sentences, and on the 29th of November, 1616, had the vicarage of St. Thomas, in the west suburb of Oxford, conferred on him by the dean and canons of Christ Church, which, with the rectory of Segrave, in Leicestershire, given to him in the year 1636, by George, Lord Berkeley, he kept, to use the words of the Oxford antiquary, with much ado to his dying day. He seems to have been first beneficed at Walsby, in Lincolnshire, through the munificence of his noble patroness, Frances, Countess Dowager of Exeter, but resigned the same, as he tells us, for some special reasons. At his vicarage he is remarked to have always given the sacrament in wafers. Wood&#39;s character of him is, that he was an exact mathematician, a curious calculator of nativities, a general read scholar, a thorough-paced philologist, and one that understood the surveying of lands well. As he was by many accounted a severe student, a devourer of authors, a melancholy and humorous person; so by others, who knew him well, a person of great honesty, plain dealing and charity. I have heard some of the ancients of Christ Church often say, that his company was very merry, facete, and juvenile; and no man in his time did surpass him for his ready and dexterous interlarding his common discourses among them with verses from the poets, or sentences from classic authors; which being then all the fashion in the University, made his company the more acceptable. He appears to have been a universal reader of all kinds of books, and availed himself of his multifarious studies in a very extraordinary manner. From the information of Hearne, we learn that John Rouse, the Bodleian librarian, furnished him with choice books for the prosecution of his work. The subject of his labour and amusement, seems to have been adopted from the infirmities of his own habit and constitution. Mr. Granger says, He composed this book with a view of relieving his own melancholy, but increased it to such a degree, that nothing could make him laugh, but going to the bridge-foot and hearing the ribaldry of the bargemen, which rarely failed to throw him into a violent fit of laughter. Before he was overcome with this horrid disorder, he, in the intervals of his vapours, was esteemed one of the most facetious companions in the University.</p>
<p>His residence was chiefly at Oxford; where, in his chamber in Christ Church College, he departed this life, at or very near the time which he had some years before foretold, from the calculation of his own nativity, and which, says Wood, being exact, several of the students did not forbear to whisper among themselves, that rather than there should be a mistake in the calculation, he sent up his soul to heaven through a slip about his neck. Whether this suggestion is founded in truth, we have no other evidence than an obscure hint in the epitaph hereafter inserted, which was written by the author himself, a short time before his death. His body, with due solemnity, was buried near that of Dr. Robert Weston, in the north aisle which joins next to the choir of the cathedral of Christ Church, on the 27th of January 1639-40. Over his grave was soon after erected a comely monument, on the upper pillar of the said aisle, with his bust, painted to the life. On the right hand is the following calculation of his nativity: </p>

<p>Probatum fuit Testamentum suprascriptum, &amp;c. 11� 1640 Juramento Willmi Burton Fris&#39; et Executoris cui &amp;c. de bene et fideliter administrand. &amp;c. coram Mag&#39;ris Nathanaele Stephens Rectore Eccl. de Drayton, et Edwardo Farmer, Clericis, vigore commissionis, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The only work our author executed was that now reprinted, which probably was the principal employment of his life. Dr. Ferriar says, it was originally published in the year 1617; but this is evidently a mistake;  the first edition was that printed in 4to, 1621, a copy of which is at present in the collection of John Nichols, Esq., the indefatigable illustrator of the History of Leicestershire; to whom, and to Isaac Reed, Esq., of Staple Inn, this account is greatly indebted for its accuracy. The other impressions of it were in 1624, 1628, 1632, 1638, 1651-2, 1660, and 1676, which last, in the titlepage, is called the eighth edition.</p>
<p>The copy from which the present is reprinted, is that of 1651-2; at the conclusion of which is the following address:</p>
<p>&quot;TO THE READER.</p>
<p>Be pleased to know (Courteous Reader) that since the last Impression of this Book, the ingenuous Author of it is deceased, leaving a Copy of it exactly corrected, with several considerable Additions by his own hand; this Copy he committed to my care and custody, with directions to have those Additions inserted in the next Edition; which in order to his command, and the Publicke Good, is faithfully performed in this last Impression.</p>
<p>H. C. (<em>i.e. HEN. CRIPPS.</em>)</p>
<p>The following testimonies of various authors will serve to show the estimation in which this work has been held:—</p>
<p>The ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, wherein the author hath piled up variety of much excellent learning. Scarce any book of philology in our land hath, in so short a time, passed so many editions.—Fuller&#39;s Worthies, fol. 16.</p>
<p>&#39;Tis a book so full of variety of reading, that gentlemen who have lost their time, and are put to a push for invention, may furnish themselves with matter for common or scholastical discourse and writing.—<em>Wood&#39;s Athenae Oxoniensis</em>, vol. i. p. 628. 2d edit.</p>
<p>If you never saw BURTON UPON MELANCHOLY, printed 1676, I pray look into it, and read the ninth page of his Preface, &#39;Democritus to the Reader.&#39; There is something there which touches the point we are upon; but I mention the author to you, as the pleasantest, the most learned, and the most full of sterling sense. The wits of Queen Anne&#39;s reign, and the beginning of George the First, were not a little beholden to him.—<em>Archbishop Herring&#39;s Letters</em>, 12mo. 1777. p. 149.</p>
<p>BURTON&#39;S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, he (Dr. Johnson) said, was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise.—<em>Boswell&#39;s Life of Johnson</em>, vol. i. p. 580. 8vo. edit.</p>
<p>BURTON&#39;S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY is a valuable book, said Dr. Johnson. It is, perhaps, overloaded with quotation. But there is great spirit and great power in what Burton says when he writes from his own mind.—<em>Ibid</em>, vol. ii. p. 325.</p>
<p>It will be no detraction from the powers of Milton&#39;s original genius and invention, to remark, that he seems to have borrowed the subject of <em>L&#39; Allegro</em> and <em>Il Penseroso</em>, together with some particular thoughts, expressions, and rhymes, more especially the idea of a contrast between these two dispositions, from a forgotten poem prefixed to the first edition of BURTON&#39;S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, entitled, &#39;The Author&#39;s Abstract of Melancholy; or, A Dialogue between Pleasure and Pain.&#39; Here pain is melancholy. It was written, as I conjecture, about the year 1600. I will make no apology for abstracting and citing as much of this poem as will be sufficient to prove, to a discerning reader, how far it had taken possession of Milton&#39;s mind. The measure will appear to be the same; and that our author was at least an attentive reader of Burton&#39;s book, may be already concluded from the traces of resemblance which I have incidentally noticed in passing through the <em>L&#39; Allegro</em> and <em>Il Penseroso</em>.—After extracting the lines, Mr. Warton adds, as to the very elaborate work to which these visionary verses are no unsuitable introduction, the writer&#39;s variety of learning, his quotations from scarce and curious books, his pedantry sparkling with rude wit and shapeless elegance, miscellaneous matter, intermixture of agreeable tales and illustrations, and, perhaps, above all, the singularities of his feelings, clothed in an uncommon quaintness of style, have contributed to render it, even to modern readers, a valuable repository of amusement and information.—<em>Warton&#39;s Milton</em>, 2d edit. p. 94.</p>
<p>THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY is a book which has been universally read and admired. This work is, for the most part, what the author himself styles it, &#39;a cento;&#39; but it is a very ingenious one. His quotations, which abound in every page, are pertinent; but if he had made more use of his invention and less of his commonplace-book, his work would perhaps have been more valuable than it is. He is generally free from the affected language and ridiculous metaphors which disgrace most of the books of his time.—<em>Granger&#39;s Biographical History</em>.</p>
<p>BURTON&#39;S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY, a book once the favourite of the learned and the witty, and a source of surreptitious learning, though written on a regular plan, consists chiefly of quotations: the author has honestly termed it a cento. He collects, under every division, the opinions of a multitude of writers, without regard to chronological order, and has too often the modesty to decline the interposition of his own sentiments. Indeed the bulk of his materials generally overwhelms him. In the course of his folio he has contrived to treat a great variety of topics, that seem very loosely connected with the general subject; and, like Bayle, when he starts a favourite train of quotations, he does not scruple to let the digression outrun the principal question. Thus, from the doctrines of religion to military discipline, from inland navigation to the morality of dancing-schools, every thing is discussed and determined.—<em>Ferriar&#39;s Illustrations of Sterne</em>, p. 58.</p>
<p>The archness which BURTON displays occasionally, and his indulgence of playful digressions from the most serious discussions, often give his style an air of familiar conversation, notwithstanding the laborious collections which supply his text. He was capable of writing excellent poetry, but he seems to have cultivated this talent too little. The English verses prefixed to his book, which possess beautiful imagery, and great sweetness of versification, have been frequently published. His Latin elegiac verses addressed to his book, shew a very agreeable turn for raillery.—<em>Ibid</em>. p. 58.</p>
<p>When the force of the subject opens his own vein of prose, we discover valuable sense and brilliant expression. Such is his account of the first feelings of melancholy persons, written, probably, from his own experience. [See p. 154, of the present edition.]—<em>Ibid.</em> p. 60.</p>
<p>During a pedantic age, like that in which BURTON&#39;S production appeared, it must have been eminently serviceable to writers of many descriptions. Hence the unlearned might furnish themselves with appropriate scraps of Greek and Latin, whilst men of letters would find their enquiries shortened, by knowing where they might look for what both ancients and moderns had advanced on the subject of human passions. I confess my inability to point out any other English author who has so largely dealt in apt and original quotation.—<em>Manuscript note of the late George Steevens, Esq., in his copy of</em> THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY.</p>

<h3>DEMOCRITUS JUNIOR AD LIBRUM SUUM.</h3>
<pre><code>Vade liber, qualis, non ausum dicere, felix,
Te nisi felicem fecerit Alma dies.
Vade tamen quocunque lubet, quascunque per oras,
Et Genium Domini fac imitere tui.
I blandas inter Charites, mystamque saluta
Musarum quemvis, si tibi lector erit.
Rura colas, urbem, subeasve palatia regum,
Submisse, placide, te sine dente geras.
Nobilis, aut si quis te forte inspexerit heros,
Da te morigerum, perlegat usque lubet.
Est quod Nobilitas, est quod desideret heros,

Si quis morosus Cato, tetricusque Senator,
Hunc etiam librum forte videre velit,
Sive magistratus, tum te reverenter habeto;
Sed nullus; muscas non capiunt Aquilae.
Non vacat his tempus fugitivum impendere nugis,
Nec tales cupio; par mihi lector erit.
Si matrona gravis casu diverterit istuc,
Illustris domina, aut te Comitissa legat:
Est quod displiceat, placeat quod forsitan illis,
Ingerere his noli te modo, pande tamen.
At si virgo tuas dignabitur inclyta chartas

Expungi, quae jam displicuisse sciat.
Sive Melancholicus quisquam, seu blandus Amator,

Huc appellat, age et tuto te crede legenti,
Multa istic forsan non male nata leget.
Quod fugiat, caveat, quodque amplexabitur, ista

At si quis Medicus coram te sistet, amice

Inveniet namque ipse meis quoque plurima scriptis,
Non leve subsidium quae sibi forsan erunt.
Si quis Causidicus chartas impingat in istas,
Nil mihi vobiscum, pessima turba vale;
Sit nisi vir bonus, et juris sine fraude peritus,
Tum legat, et forsan doctior inde siet.
Si quis cordatus, facilis, lectorque benignus
Huc oculos vertat, quae velit ipse legat;
Candidus ignoscet, metuas nil, pande libenter,
Offensus mendis non erit ille tuis,
Laudabit nonnulla. Venit si Rhetor ineptus,
Limata et tersa, et qui bene cocta petit,

Offendent stomachum quae minus apta suum.

<h3>DEMOCRITUS JUNIOR TO HIS BOOK</h3>
<h4>PARAPHRASTIC METRICAL TRANSLATION.</h4>
<pre><code>Go forth my book into the open day;
Happy, if made so by its garish eye.
O&#39;er earth&#39;s wide surface take thy vagrant way,
To imitate thy master&#39;s genius try.
The Graces three, the Muses nine salute,
Should those who love them try to con thy lore.
The country, city seek, grand thrones to boot,
With gentle courtesy humbly bow before.
Should nobles gallant, soldiers frank and brave
Seek thy acquaintance, hail their first advance:
From twitch of care thy pleasant vein may save,
May laughter cause or wisdom give perchance.
Some surly Cato, Senator austere,
Haply may wish to peep into thy book:
Seem very nothing—tremble and revere:
No forceful eagles, butterflies e&#39;er look.
They love not thee: of them then little seek,
And wish for readers triflers like thyself.
Of ludeful matron watchful catch the beck,
Or gorgeous countess full of pride and pelf.
They may say pish! and frown, and yet read on:
Cry odd, and silly, coarse, and yet amusing.
Should dainty damsels seek thy page to con,
Spread thy best stores: to them be ne&#39;er refusing:
Say, fair one, master loves thee dear as life;
Would he were here to gaze on thy sweet look.
Should known or unknown student, freed from strife
Of logic and the schools, explore my book:
Cry mercy critic, and thy book withhold:
Be some few errors pardon&#39;d though observ&#39;d:
An humble author to implore makes bold.
Thy kind indulgence, even undeserv&#39;d,
Should melancholy wight or pensive lover,
Courtier, snug cit, or carpet knight so trim
Our blossoms cull, he&#39;ll find himself in clover,
Gain sense from precept, laughter from our whim.
Should learned leech with solemn air unfold
Thy leaves, beware, be civil, and be wise:
Thy volume many precepts sage may hold,
His well fraught head may find no trifling prize.
Should crafty lawyer trespass on our ground,
Caitiffs avaunt! disturbing tribe away!
Unless (white crow) an honest one be found;
He&#39;ll better, wiser go for what we say.
Should some ripe scholar, gentle and benign,
With candour, care, and judgment thee peruse:
Thy faults to kind oblivion he&#39;ll consign;
Nor to thy merit will his praise refuse.
Thou may&#39;st be searched for polish&#39;d words and verse
By flippant spouter, emptiest of praters:
Tell him to seek them in some mawkish verse:
My periods all are rough as nutmeg graters.
The doggerel poet, wishing thee to read,
Reject not; let him glean thy jests and stories.
His brother I, of lowly sembling breed:
Apollo grants to few Parnassian glories.
Menac&#39;d by critic with sour furrowed brow,
Momus or Troilus or Scotch reviewer:
Ruffle your heckle, grin and growl and vow:
Ill-natured foes you thus will find the fewer,
When foul-mouth&#39;d senseless railers cry thee down,
Reply not: fly, and show the rogues thy stern;
They are not worthy even of a frown:
Good taste or breeding they can never learn;
Or let them clamour, turn a callous ear,
As though in dread of some harsh donkey&#39;s bray.
If chid by censor, friendly though severe,
To such explain and turn thee not away.
Thy vein, says he perchance, is all too free;
Thy smutty language suits not learned pen:
Reply, Good Sir, throughout, the context see;
Thought chastens thought; so prithee judge again.
Besides, although my master&#39;s pen may wander
Through devious paths, by which it ought not stray,
His life is pure, beyond the breath of slander:
So pardon grant; &#39;tis merely but his way.
Some rugged ruffian makes a hideous rout—
Brandish thy cudgel, threaten him to baste;
The filthy fungus far from thee cast out;
Such noxious banquets never suit my taste.
Yet, calm and cautious moderate thy ire,
Be ever courteous should the case allow—
Sweet malt is ever made by gentle fire:
Warm to thy friends, give all a civil bow.
Even censure sometimes teaches to improve,
Slight frosts have often cured too rank a crop,
So, candid blame my spleen shall never move,
For skilful gard&#39;ners wayward branches lop.
Go then, my book, and bear my words in mind;
Guides safe at once, and pleasant them you&#39;ll find.</code></pre><hr>

<h3>THE AUTHOR&#39;S ABSTRACT OF MELANCHOLY, Διαλογῶς</h3>
<pre><code>When I go musing all alone
Thinking of divers things fore-known.
When I build castles in the air,
Void of sorrow and void of fear,
Pleasing myself with phantasms sweet,
Methinks the time runs very fleet.
All my joys to this are folly,
Naught so sweet as melancholy.
When I lie waking all alone,
Recounting what I have ill done,
My thoughts on me then tyrannise,
Fear and sorrow me surprise,
Whether I tarry still or go,
Methinks the time moves very slow.
All my griefs to this are jolly,
Naught so mad as melancholy.
When to myself I act and smile,
With pleasing thoughts the time beguile,
By a brook side or wood so green,
Unheard, unsought for, or unseen,
A thousand pleasures do me bless,
And crown my soul with happiness.
All my joys besides are folly,
None so sweet as melancholy.
When I lie, sit, or walk alone,
I sigh, I grieve, making great moan,
In a dark grove, or irksome den,
With discontents and Furies then,
A thousand miseries at once
Mine heavy heart and soul ensconce,
All my griefs to this are jolly,
None so sour as melancholy.
Methinks I hear, methinks I see,
Sweet music, wondrous melody,
Towns, palaces, and cities fine;
Here now, then there; the world is mine,
Rare beauties, gallant ladies shine,
Whate&#39;er is lovely or divine.
All other joys to this are folly,
None so sweet as melancholy.
Methinks I hear, methinks I see
Ghosts, goblins, fiends; my phantasy
Presents a thousand ugly shapes,
Headless bears, black men, and apes,
Doleful outcries, and fearful sights,
My sad and dismal soul affrights.
All my griefs to this are jolly,
None so damn&#39;d as melancholy.
Methinks I court, methinks I kiss,
Methinks I now embrace my mistress.
O blessed days, O sweet content,
In Paradise my time is spent.
Such thoughts may still my fancy move,
So may I ever be in love.
All my joys to this are folly,
Naught so sweet as melancholy.
When I recount love&#39;s many frights,
My sighs and tears, my waking nights,
My jealous fits; O mine hard fate
I now repent, but &#39;tis too late.
No torment is so bad as love,
So bitter to my soul can prove.
All my griefs to this are jolly,
Naught so harsh as melancholy.
Friends and companions get you gone,
&#39;Tis my desire to be alone;
Ne&#39;er well but when my thoughts and I
Do domineer in privacy.
No Gem, no treasure like to this,
&#39;Tis my delight, my crown, my bliss.
All my joys to this are folly,
Naught so sweet as melancholy.
&#39;Tis my sole plague to be alone,
I am a beast, a monster grown,
I will no light nor company,
I find it now my misery.
The scene is turn&#39;d, my joys are gone,
Fear, discontent, and sorrows come.
All my griefs to this are jolly,
Naught so fierce as melancholy.
I&#39;ll not change life with any king,
I ravisht am: can the world bring
More joy, than still to laugh and smile,
In pleasant toys time to beguile?
Do not, O do not trouble me,
So sweet content I feel and see.
All my joys to this are folly,
None so divine as melancholy.
I&#39;ll change my state with any wretch,
Thou canst from gaol or dunghill fetch;
My pain&#39;s past cure, another hell,
I may not in this torment dwell!
Now desperate I hate my life,
Lend me a halter or a knife;
All my griefs to this are jolly,
Naught so damn&#39;d as melancholy.</code></pre><hr>
<h3>DEMOCRITUS JUNIOR TO THE READER.</h3>
<p>Gentle reader, I presume thou wilt be very inquisitive to know what antic or personate actor this is, that so insolently intrudes upon this common theatre, to the world&#39;s view, arrogating another man&#39;s name; whence he is, why he doth it, and what he hath to say; although, as  Gellius observes, for later writers and impostors, to broach many absurd and insolent fictions, under the name of so noble a philosopher as Democritus, to get themselves credit, and by that means the more to be respected, as artificers usually do, Novo qui marmori ascribunt Praxatilem suo. &#39;Tis not so with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Non hic Centaurus, non Gorgonas, Harpyasque</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Invenies, hominem pagina nostra sapit.</p>
<p>No Centaurs here, or Gorgons look to find,</p>
<p>My subject is of man and human kind.</p>
<p>Thou thyself art the subject of my discourse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Quicquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, voluptas,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaudia, discursus, nostri farrago libelli.</p>
<p>Whate&#39;er men do, vows, fears, in ire, in sport,</p>
<p>Joys, wand&#39;rings, are the sum of my report.</p>
<p>My intent is no otherwise to use his name, than Mercurius Gallobelgicus, Mercurius Britannicus, use the name of Mercury,  Democritus Christianus, &amp;c.; although there be some other circumstances for which I have masked myself under this vizard, and some peculiar respect which I cannot so well express, until I have set down a brief character of this our Democritus, what he was, with an epitome of his life.</p>
<p>Democritus, as he is described by  and laugh heartily at such variety of ridiculous objects, which there he saw. Such a one was Democritus.</p>
<p>But in the mean time, how doth this concern me, or upon what reference do I usurp his habit? I confess, indeed, that to compare myself unto him for aught I have yet said, were both impudency and arrogancy. I do not presume to make any parallel, Antistat mihi millibus trecentis,   not as they did, to scoff or laugh at all, but with a mixed passion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Bilem saepe, jocum vestri movere tumultus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ye wretched mimics, whose fond heats have been,</p>
<p>How oft! the objects of my mirth and spleen.</p>
<p>I did sometime laugh and scoff with Lucian, and satirically tax with Menippus, lament with Heraclitus, sometimes again I was  teach others how to prevent and avoid it. Which good intent of his, Hippocrates highly commended: Democritus Junior is therefore bold to imitate, and because he left it imperfect, and it is now lost, quasi succenturiator Democriti, to revive again, prosecute, and finish in this treatise.</p>
<p>You have had a reason of the name. If the title and inscription offend your gravity, were it a sufficient justification to accuse others, I could produce many sober treatises, even sermons themselves, which in their fronts carry more fantastical names. Howsoever, it is a kind of policy in these days, to prefix a fantastical title to a book which is to be sold; for, as larks come down to a day-net, many vain readers will tarry and stand gazing like silly passengers at an antic picture in a painter&#39;s shop, that will not look at a judicious piece. And, indeed, as  precedents for this which I have done: I will cite one for all, Anthony Zara, Pap. Epis., his Anatomy of Wit, in four sections, members, subsections, &amp;c., to be read in our libraries.</p>
<p>If any man except against the matter or manner of treating of this my subject, and will demand a reason of it, I can allege more than one; I write of melancholy, by being busy to avoid melancholy. There is no greater cause of melancholy than idleness, no better cure than business, as   Rhasis holds: and howbeit, stultus labor est ineptiarum, to be busy in toys is to small purpose, yet hear that divine Seneca, aliud agere quam nihil, better do to no end, than nothing. I wrote therefore, and busied myself in this playing labour, oliosaque diligentia ut vitarem torporum feriandi with Vectius in Macrobius, atque otium in utile verterem negatium.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Simul et jucunda et idonea dicere vita,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lectorem delectando simul atque monendo.</p>
<p>Poets would profit or delight mankind,</p>
<p>And with the pleasing have th&#39; instructive joined.</p>
<p>Profit and pleasure, then, to mix with art,</p>
<p>T&#39; inform the judgment, nor offend the heart,</p>
<p>Shall gain all votes.</p>
<p>To this end I write, like them, saith Lucian, that recite to trees, and declaim to pillars for want of auditors: as  being a leper herself, bestow all her portion to build an hospital for lepers, I will spend my time and knowledge, which are my greatest fortunes, for the common good of all.</p>
<p>Yea, but you will infer that this is  Amongst so many thousand authors you shall scarce find one, by reading of whom you shall be any whit better, but rather much worse, quibus inficitur potius, quam perficitur, by which he is rather infected than any way perfected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———Qui talia legit,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quid didicit tandem, quid scit nisi somnia, nugas?</p>
<p>So that oftentimes it falls out (which Callimachus taxed of old) a great book is a great mischief.  Princes show their armies, rich men vaunt their buildings, soldiers their manhood, and scholars vent their toys; they must read, they must hear whether they will or no.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Et quodcunque semel chartis illeverit, omnes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gestiet a furno redeuntes scire lacuque,</p>
<p>Et pueros et anus———</p>
<p>What once is said and writ, all men must know,</p>
<p>Old wives and children as they come and go.</p>
<p>What a company of poets hath this year brought out, as Pliny complains to Sossius Sinesius.  Wecker e Ter. nihil dictum quod non dictum prius, methodus sola artificem ostendit, we can say nothing but what hath been said, the composition and method is ours only, and shows a scholar. Oribasius, Aesius, Avicenna, have all out of Galen, but to their own method, diverso stilo, non diversa fide. Our poets steal from Homer; he spews, saith Aelian, they lick it up. Divines use Austin&#39;s words verbatim still, and our story-dressers do as much; he that comes last is commonly best,</p>
<p>——donec quid grandius aetas</p>
<p>Postera sorsque ferat melior.——— </p>
<p>Though there were many giants of old in physic and philosophy, yet I say with  Didacus Stella, A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a giant himself; I may likely add, alter, and see farther than my predecessors; and it is no greater prejudice for me to indite after others, than for Aelianus Montaltus, that famous physician, to write de morbis capitis after Jason Pratensis, Heurnius, Hildesheim, &amp;c., many horses to run in a race, one logician, one rhetorician, after another. Oppose then what thou wilt,</p>
<p>Allatres licet usque nos et usque</p>
<p>Et gannitibus improbis lacessas.</p>
<p>I solve it thus. And for those other faults of barbarism,  thou censurest me, so have I done others, and may do thee, Cedimus inque vicem, &amp;c., &#39;tis lex talionis, quid pro quo. Go now, censure, criticise, scoff, and rail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Nasutus cis usque licet, sis denique nasus:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non potes in nugas dicere plura meas,</p>
<p>Ipse ego quam dixi, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Wert thou all scoffs and flouts, a very Momus,</p>
<p>Than we ourselves, thou canst not say worse of us.</p>
<p>Thus, as when women scold, have I cried whore first, and in some men&#39;s censures I am afraid I have overshot myself, Laudare se vani, vituperare stulti, as I do not arrogate, I will not derogate. Primus vestrum non sum, nec imus, I am none of the best, I am none of the meanest of you. As I am an inch, or so many feet, so many parasangs, after him or him, I may be peradventure an ace before thee. Be it therefore as it is, well or ill, I have essayed, put myself upon the stage; I must abide the censure, I may not escape it. It is most true, stylus virum arguit, our style bewrays us, and as  hunters find their game by the trace, so is a man&#39;s genius descried by his works, Multo melius ex sermone quam lineamentis, de moribus hominum judicamus; it was old Cato&#39;s rule. I have laid myself open (I know it) in this treatise, turned mine inside outward: I shall be censured, I doubt not; for, to say truth with Erasmus, nihil morosius hominum judiciis, there is nought so peevish as men&#39;s judgments; yet this is some comfort, ut palata, sic judicia, our censures are as various as our palates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poscentes vario multum diversa palato, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Three guests I have, dissenting at my feast,</p>
<p>Requiring each to gratify his taste</p>
<p>With different food.</p>
<p>Our writings are as so many dishes, our readers guests, our books like beauty, that which one admires another rejects; so are we approved as men&#39;s fancies are inclined. Pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli.. That which is most pleasing to one is amaracum sui, most harsh to another. Quot homines, tot sententiae, so many men, so many minds: that which thou condemnest he commends.  Facilia sic putant omnes quae jam facta, nec de salebris cogitant, ubi via strata; so men are valued, their labours vilified by fellows of no worth themselves, as things of nought, who could not have done as much. Unusquisque abundat sensu suo, every man abounds in his own sense; and whilst each particular party is so affected, how should one please all?</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Quid dem? quid non dem? Renuis tu quod jubet ille.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>——What courses must I choose?</p>
<p>What not? What both would order you refuse.</p>
<p>How shall I hope to express myself to each man&#39;s humour and  vilified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———laudatus abunde,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non fastiditus si tibi, lector, ero.</p>
<p>I fear good men&#39;s censures, and to their favourable acceptance I submit my labours,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———et linguas mancipiorum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contemno.———</p>
<p>As the barking of a dog, I securely contemn those malicious and scurrile obloquies, flouts, calumnies of railers and detractors; I scorn the rest. What therefore I have said, pro tenuitate mea, I have said.</p>
<p>One or two things yet I was desirous to have amended if I could, concerning the manner of handling this my subject, for which I must apologise, deprecari, and upon better advice give the friendly reader notice: it was not mine intent to prostitute my muse in English, or to divulge secreta Minervae, but to have exposed this more contract in Latin, if I could have got it printed. Any scurrile pamphlet is welcome to our mercenary stationers in English; they print all</p>
<p>——cuduntque libellos</p>
<p>In quorum foliis vix simia nuda cacaret;</p>
<p>But in Latin they will not deal; which is one of the reasons  Nicholas Car, in his oration of the paucity of English writers, gives, that so many flourishing wits are smothered in oblivion, lie dead and buried in this our nation. Another main fault is, that I have not revised the copy, and amended the style, which now flows remissly, as it was first conceived; but my leisure would not permit; Feci nec quod potui, nec quod volui, I confess it is neither as I would, nor as it should be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Cum relego scripsisse pudet, quia plurima cerno</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me quoque quae fuerant judice digna lini.</p>
<p>When I peruse this tract which I have writ,</p>
<p>I am abash&#39;d, and much I hold unfit.</p>
<p>Et quod gravissimum, in the matter itself, many things I disallow at this present, which when I writ,  Non eadem est aetas, non mens; I would willingly retract much, &amp;c., but &#39;tis too late, I can only crave pardon now for what is amiss.</p>
<p>I might indeed, (had I wisely done) observed that precept of the poet, ———nonumque prematur in annum, and have taken more care: or, as Alexander the physician would have done by lapis lazuli, fifty times washed before it be used, I should have revised, corrected and amended this tract; but I had not (as I said) that happy leisure, no amanuenses or assistants. Pancrates in  He that is conversant about matter, neglects words, and those that excel in this art of speaking, have no profound learning,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Verba nitent phaleris, at nullus verba medullas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intus habent———</p>
<p>Besides, it was the observation of that wise Seneca,  glebosa camporum, through variety of objects, that which thou shalt like and surely dislike.</p>
<p>For the matter itself or method, if it be faulty, consider I pray you that of Columella, Nihil perfectum, aut a singulari consummatum industria, no man can observe all, much is defective no doubt, may be justly taxed, altered, and avoided in Galen, Aristotle, those great masters. Boni venatoris ( Sint musis socii Charites, Furia omnis abesto, otherwise, as in ordinary controversies, funem contentionis nectamus, sed cui bono? We may contend, and likely misuse each other, but to what purpose? We are both scholars, say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———Arcades ambo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Et Cantare pares, et respondere parati.</p>
<p>Both young Arcadians, both alike inspir&#39;d</p>
<p>To sing and answer as the song requir&#39;d.</p>
<p>If we do wrangle, what shall we get by it? Trouble and wrong ourselves, make sport to others. If I be convict of an error, I will yield, I will amend. Si quid bonis moribus, si quid veritati dissentaneum, in sacris vel humanis literis a me dictum sit, id nec dictum esto. In the mean time I require a favourable censure of all faults omitted, harsh compositions, pleonasms of words, tautological repetitions (though Seneca bear me out, nunquam nimis dicitur, quod nunquam satis dicitur) perturbations of tenses, numbers, printers&#39; faults, &amp;c. My translations are sometimes rather paraphrases than interpretations, non ad verbum, but as an author, I use more liberty, and that&#39;s only taken which was to my purpose. Quotations are often inserted in the text, which makes the style more harsh, or in the margin, as it happened. Greek authors, Plato, Plutarch, Athenaeus, &amp;c., I have cited out of their interpreters, because the original was not so ready. I have mingled sacra prophanis, but I hope not profaned, and in repetition of authors&#39; names, ranked them per accidens, not according to chronology; sometimes neoterics before ancients, as my memory suggested. Some things are here altered, expunged in this sixth edition, others amended, much added, because many good  authors in all kinds are come to my hands since, and &#39;tis no prejudice, no such indecorum, or oversight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Nunquam ita quicquam bene subducta ratione ad vitam fuit,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quin res, aetas, usus, semper aliquid apportent novi,</p>
<p>Aliquid moneant, ut illa quae scire te credas, nescias,</p>
<p>Et quae tibi putaris prima, in exercendo ut repudias.</p>
<p>Ne&#39;er was ought yet at first contriv&#39;d so fit,</p>
<p>But use, age, or something would alter it;</p>
<p>Advise thee better, and, upon peruse,</p>
<p>Make thee not say, and what thou tak&#39;st refuse.</p>
<p>But I am now resolved never to put this treatise out again, Ne quid nimis, I will not hereafter add, alter, or retract; I have done. The last and greatest exception is, that I, being a divine, have meddled with physic,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Tantumne est ab re tua otii tibi,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aliena ut cures, eaque nihil quae ad te attinent.</p>
<p>Which Menedemus objected to Chremes; have I so much leisure, or little business of mine own, as to look after other men&#39;s matters which concern me not? What have I to do with physic? Quod medicorum est promittant medici. The  Fabius said, It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.</p>
<p>At melius fuerat non scribere, namque tacere</p>
<p>Tutum semper erit,——— </p>
<p>&#39;Tis a general fault, so Severinus the Dane complains  in physic, unhappy men as we are, we spend our days in unprofitable questions and disputations, intricate subtleties, de lana caprina about moonshine in the water, leaving in the mean time those chiefest treasures of nature untouched, wherein the best medicines for all manner of diseases are to be found, and do not only neglect them ourselves, but hinder, condemn, forbid, and scoff at others, that are willing to inquire after them. These motives at this present have induced me to make choice of this medicinal subject.</p>
<p>If any physician in the mean time shall infer, Ne sutor ultra crepidam, and find himself grieved that I have intruded into his profession, I will tell him in brief, I do not otherwise by them, than they do by us. If it be for their advantage, I know many of their sect which have taken orders, in hope of a benefice, &#39;tis a common transition, and why may not a melancholy divine, that can get nothing but by simony, profess physic? Drusianus an Italian (Crusianus, but corruptly, Trithemius calls him)  our Regius Professor of physic well informed us in a learned lecture of his not long since. One helps the vices and passions of the soul, anger, lust, desperation, pride, presumption, &amp;c. by applying that spiritual physic; as the other uses proper remedies in bodily diseases. Now this being a common infirmity of body and soul, and such a one that hath as much need of spiritual as a corporal cure, I could not find a fitter task to busy myself about, a more apposite theme, so necessary, so commodious, and generally concerning all sorts of men, that should so equally participate of both, and require a whole physician. A divine in this compound mixed malady can do little alone, a physician in some kinds of melancholy much less, both make an absolute cure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Alterius sic altera poscit opem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>——when in friendship joined</p>
<p>A mutual succour in each other find.</p>
<p>And &#39;tis proper to them both, and I hope not unbeseeming me, who am by my profession a divine, and by mine inclination a physician. I had Jupiter in my sixth house; I say with  Beroaldus, non sum medicus, nec medicinae prorsus expers, in the theory of physic I have taken some pains, not with an intent to practice, but to satisfy myself, which was a cause likewise of the first undertaking of this subject.</p>
<p>If these reasons do not satisfy thee, good reader, as Alexander Munificus that bountiful prelate, sometimes bishop of Lincoln, when he had built six castles, ad invidiam operis eluendam, saith  Agrippa de occ. Phil.) et caveant lectores ne cerebrum iis excutiat. The rest I doubt not they may securely read, and to their benefit. But I am over-tedious, I proceed.</p>
<p>Of the necessity and generality of this which I have said, if any man doubt, I shall desire him to make a brief survey of the world, as  Strabo&#39;s time they did) as in our days they run to Compostella, our Lady of Sichem, or Lauretta, to seek for help; that it is like to be as prosperous a voyage as that of Guiana, and that there is much more need of hellebore than of tobacco.</p>
<p>That men are so misaffected, melancholy, mad, giddy-headed, hear the testimony of Solomon, Eccl. ii. 12. And I turned to behold wisdom, madness and folly, &amp;c. And ver. 23: All his days are sorrow, his travel grief, and his heart taketh no rest in the night. So that take melancholy in what sense you will, properly or improperly, in disposition or habit, for pleasure or for pain, dotage, discontent, fear, sorrow, madness, for part, or all, truly, or metaphorically, &#39;tis all one. Laughter itself is madness according to Solomon, and as St. Paul hath it, Worldly sorrow brings death. The hearts of the sons of men are evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, Eccl. ix. 3. Wise men themselves are no better. Eccl. i. 18. In the multitude of wisdom is much grief, and he that increaseth wisdom, increaseth sorrow, chap. ii. 17. He hated life itself, nothing pleased him: he hated his labour, all, as  he concludes, is sorrow, grief, vanity, vexation of spirit. And though he were the wisest man in the world, sanctuarium sapientiae, and had wisdom in abundance, he will not vindicate himself, or justify his own actions. Surely I am more foolish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man in me, Prov. xxx. 2. Be they Solomon&#39;s words, or the words of Agur, the son of Jakeh, they are canonical. David, a man after God&#39;s own heart, confesseth as much of himself, Psal. xxxvii. 21, 22. So foolish was I and ignorant, I was even as a beast before thee. And condemns all for fools, Psal. xciii.; xxxii. 9; xlix. 20. He compares them to beasts, horses, and mules, in which there is no understanding. The apostle Paul accuseth himself in like sort, 2 Cor. ix. 21. I would you would suffer a little my foolishness, I speak foolishly. The whole head is sick, saith Esay, and the heart is heavy, cap. i. 5. And makes lighter of them than of oxen and asses, the ox knows his owner, &amp;c.: read Deut. xxxii. 6; Jer. iv.; Amos, iii. 1; Ephes. v. 6. Be not mad, be not deceived, foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you? How often are they branded with this epithet of madness and folly? No word so frequent amongst the fathers of the Church and divines; you may see what an opinion they had of the world, and how they valued men&#39;s actions.</p>
<p>I know that we think far otherwise, and hold them most part wise men that are in authority, princes, magistrates,  For what can be more mad, than for a little worldly pleasure to procure unto themselves eternal punishment? As Gregory and others inculcate unto us.</p>
<p>Yea even all those great philosophers the world hath ever had in admiration, whose works we do so much esteem, that gave precepts of wisdom to others, inventors of Arts and Sciences, Socrates the wisest man of his time by the Oracle of Apollo, whom his two scholars,   Alcibiades incomparably commends him; Achilles was a worthy man, but Bracides and others were as worthy as himself; Antenor and Nestor were as good as Pericles, and so of the rest; but none present, before, or after Socrates, nemo veterum neque eorum qui nunc sunt, were ever such, will match, or come near him. Those seven wise men of Greece, those Britain Druids, Indian Brachmanni, Ethiopian Gymnosophist, Magi of the Persians, Apollonius, of whom Philostratus, Non doctus, sed natus sapiens, wise from his cradle, Eoicuras so much admired by his scholar Lucretius:</p>

<p>As the sun rising doth obscure a star,</p>
<p>Or that so much renowned Empedocles,</p>

<p>All those of whom we read such  a miracle of nature, breathing libraries, as Eunapius of Longinus, lights of nature, giants for wit, quintessence of wit, divine spirits, eagles in the clouds, fallen from heaven, gods, spirits, lamps of the world, dictators, Nulla ferant talem saecla futura virum: monarchs, miracles, superintendents of wit and learning, oceanus, phoenix, atlas, monstrum, portentum hominis, orbis universi musaeum, ultimus humana naturae donatus, naturae maritus,</p>
<p>——merito cui doctior orbis</p>
<p>Submissis defert fascibus imperium.</p>
<p>As Aelian writ of Protagoras and Gorgias, we may say of them all, tantum a sapientibus abfuerunt, quantum a viris pueri, they were children in respect, infants, not eagles, but kites; novices, illiterate, Eunuchi sapientiae. And although they were the wisest, and most admired in their age, as he censured Alexander, I do them, there were 10,000 in his army as worthy captains (had they been in place of command) as valiant as himself; there were myriads of men wiser in those days, and yet all short of what they ought to be.   Xenodotus&#39; heart, Crates&#39; liver, Epictetus&#39; lantern, were so sottish, and had no more brains than so many beetles, what shall we think of the commonalty? what of the rest?</p>
<p>Yea, but you will infer, that is true of heathens, if they be conferred with Christians, 1 Cor. iii. 19. The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, earthly and devilish, as James calls it, iii. 15. They were vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was full of darkness, Rom. i. 21, 22. When they professed themselves wise, became fools. Their witty works are admired here on earth, whilst their souls are tormented in hell fire. In some sense, Christiani Crassiani, Christians are Crassians, and if compared to that wisdom, no better than fools. Quis est sapiens? Solus Deus,  Vitam regit fortuna, non sapientia.</p>
<p>When  Tully, I see everything to be done foolishly and unadvisedly.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> Desipiunt omnes aeque ac tu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they who call you fool, with equal claim</p>
<p>May plead an ample title to the name.</p>
<p>&#39;Tis an inbred malady in every one of us, there is seminarium stultitiae, a seminary of folly, which if it be stirred up, or get ahead, will run in infinitum, and infinitely varies, as we ourselves are severally addicted, saith  Sic plerumque agitat stultos inscitia, as he that examines his own and other men&#39;s actions shall find.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> O saeclum insipiens et infacetum, a giddy-headed age. Heraclitus the philosopher, out of a serious meditation of men&#39;s lives, fell a weeping, and with continual tears bewailed their misery, madness, and folly. Democritus on the other side, burst out a laughing, their whole life seemed to him so ridiculous, and he was so far carried with this ironical passion, that the citizens of Abdera took him to be mad, and sent therefore ambassadors to Hippocrates, the physician, that he would exercise his skill upon him. But the story is set down at large by Hippocrates, in his epistle to Damogetus, which because it is not impertinent to this discourse, I will insert verbatim almost as it is delivered by Hippocrates himself, with all the circumstances belonging unto it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Hippocrates was now come to Abdera, the people of the city came flocking about him, some weeping, some intreating of him, that he would do his best. After some little repast, he went to see Democritus, the people following him, whom he found (as before) in his garden in the suburbs all alone,  for no man will mock his own folly, but that which he seeth in a second, and so they justly mock one another. The drunkard calls him a glutton whom he knows to be sober. Many men love the sea, others husbandry; briefly, they cannot agree in their own trades and professions, much less in their lives and actions.</p>
<p>When Hippocrates heard these words so readily uttered, without premeditation, to declare the world&#39;s vanity, full of ridiculous contrariety, he made answer, that necessity compelled men to many such actions, and divers wills ensuing from divine permission, that we might not be idle, being nothing is so odious to them as sloth and negligence. Besides, men cannot foresee future events, in this uncertainty of human affairs; they would not so marry, if they could foretell the causes of their dislike and separation; or parents, if they knew the hour of their children&#39;s death, so tenderly provide for them; or an husbandman sow, if he thought there would be no increase; or a merchant adventure to sea, if he foresaw shipwreck; or be a magistrate, if presently to be deposed. Alas, worthy Democritus, every man hopes the best, and to that end he doth it, and therefore no such cause, or ridiculous occasion of laughter.</p>
<p>Democritus hearing this poor excuse, laughed again aloud, perceiving he wholly mistook him, and did not well understand what he had said concerning perturbations and tranquillity of the mind. Insomuch, that if men would govern their actions by discretion and providence, they would not declare themselves fools as now they do, and he should have no cause of laughter; but (quoth he) they swell in this life as if they were immortal, and demigods, for want of understanding. It were enough to make them wise, if they would but consider the mutability of this world, and how it wheels about, nothing being firm and sure. He that is now above, tomorrow is beneath; he that sate on this side today, tomorrow is hurled on the other: and not considering these matters, they fall into many inconveniences and troubles, coveting things of no profit, and thirsting after them, tumbling headlong into many calamities. So that if men would attempt no more than what they can bear, they should lead contented lives, and learning to know themselves, would limit their ambition,  folly seems wisdom, will not be cured, and perceive it not?</p>
<p>It grew late: Hippocrates left him; and no sooner was he come away, but all the citizens came about flocking, to know how he liked him. He told them in brief, that notwithstanding those small neglects of his attire, body, diet,  the world had not a wiser, a more learned, a more honest man, and they were much deceived to say that he was mad.</p>
<p>Thus Democritus esteemed of the world in his time, and this was the cause of his laughter: and good cause he had.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Olim jure quidem, nunc plus Democrite ride;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quin rides? vita haec nunc mage ridicula est.</p>
<p>Democritus did well to laugh of old,</p>
<p>Good cause he had, but now much more;</p>
<p>This life of ours is more ridiculous</p>
<p>Than that of his, or long before.</p>
<p>Never so much cause of laughter as now, never so many fools and madmen. &#39;Tis not one  but Jupiter perceiving what he was, a light, fantastic, idle fellow, turned him and his proud followers into butterflies: and so they continue still (for aught I know to the contrary) roving about in pied coats, and are called chrysalides by the wiser sort of men: that is, golden outsides, drones, and flies, and things of no worth. Multitudes of such, &amp;c.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———ubique invenies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stultos avaros, sycopliantas prodigos.</p>
<p>Many additions, much increase of madness, folly, vanity, should Democritus observe, were he now to travel, or could get leave of Pluto to come see fashions, as Charon did in Lucian to visit our cities of Moronia Pia, and Moronia Felix: sure I think he would break the rim of his belly with laughing.  Si foret in terris rideret Democritus, seu, &amp;c.</p>
<p>A satirical Roman in his time, thought all vice, folly, and madness were all at full sea,  Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Josephus the historian taxeth his countrymen Jews for bragging of their vices, publishing their follies, and that they did contend amongst themselves who should be most notorious in villainies; but we flow higher in madness, far beyond them,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> Mox daturi progeniem vitiosorem,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet with crimes to us unknown,</p>
<p>Our sons shall mark the coming age their own,</p>
<p>and the latter end (you know whose oracle it is) is like to be worse. &#39;Tis not to be denied, the world alters every day, Ruunt urbes, regna transferuntur, &amp;c. variantur habitus, leges innovantur, as  Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum; our times and persons alter, vices are the same, and ever will be; look how nightingales sang of old, cocks crowed, kine lowed, sheep bleated, sparrows chirped, dogs barked, so they do still: we keep our madness still, play the fools still, nec dum finitus Orestes; we are of the same humours and inclinations as our predecessors were; you shall find us all alike, much at one, we and our sons, Et nati natorum, et qui nascuntur ab illis. And so shall our posterity continue to the last. But to speak of times present.</p>
<p>If Democritus were alive now, and should but see the superstition of our age, our   praying in gibberish, and mumbling of beads. Had he heard an old woman say her prayers in Latin, their sprinkling of holy water, and going a procession,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———incedunt monachorum agmina mille;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quid momerem vexilla, cruces, idolaque culta, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Their breviaries, bulls, hallowed beans, exorcisms, pictures, curious crosses, fables, and baubles. Had he read the Golden Legend, the Turks&#39; Alcoran, or Jews&#39; Talmud, the Rabbins&#39; Comments, what would he have thought? How dost thou think he might have been affected? Had he more particularly examined a Jesuit&#39;s life amongst the rest, he should have seen an hypocrite profess poverty,  Lucian said in like case, what dost thou think Democritus would have done, had he been spectator of these things?</p>
<p>Or had he but observed the common people follow like so many sheep one of their fellows drawn by the horns over a gap, some for zeal, some for fear, quo se cunque rapit tempestas, to credit all, examine nothing, and yet ready to die before they will adjure any of those ceremonies to which they have been accustomed; others out of hypocrisy frequent sermons, knock their breasts, turn up their eyes, pretend zeal, desire reformation, and yet professed usurers, gripers, monsters of men, harpies, devils in their lives, to express nothing less.</p>
<p>What would he have said to see, hear, and read so many bloody battles, so many thousands slain at once, such streams of blood able to turn mills: unius ob noxam furiasque, or to make sport for princes, without any just cause,  Hercules, and I know not how many besides of old, were deified; went this way to heaven, that were indeed bloody butchers, wicked destroyers, and troublers of the world, prodigious monsters, hell-hounds, feral plagues, devourers, common executioners of human kind, as Lactantius truly proves, and Cyprian to Donat, such as were desperate in wars, and precipitately made away themselves, (like those Celts in Damascen, with ridiculous valour, ut dedecorosum putarent muro ruenti se subducere, a disgrace to run away for a rotten wall, now ready to fall on their heads,) such as will not rush on a sword&#39;s point, or seek to shun a cannon&#39;s shot, are base cowards, and no valiant men. By which means, Madet orbis mutuo sanguine, the earth wallows in her own blood,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> and which is no less than murder itself; if the same fact be done in public in wars, it is called manhood, and the party is honoured for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> ———Prosperum et felix scelus,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtus vocatur.———</p>
<p>We measure all as Turks do, by the event, and most part, as Cyprian notes, in all ages, countries, places, saevitiae magnitudo impunitatem sceleris acquirit; the foulness of the fact vindicates the offender.  Agrippa notes) for that which another should have hung in gibbets, as a terror to the rest,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———et tamen alter,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Si fecisset idem, caderet sub judice morum.</p>
<p>A poor sheep-stealer is hanged for stealing of victuals, compelled peradventure by necessity of that intolerable cold, hunger, and thirst, to save himself from starving: but a   mutter at it.</p>
<p>How would our Democritus have been affected to see a wicked caitiff or  to honour him with divine titles, and bombast epithets, to smother him with fumes and eulogies, whom they know to be a dizzard, a fool, a covetous wretch, a beast, &amp;c. because he is rich? To see sub exuviis leonis onagrum, a filthy loathsome carcass, a Gorgon&#39;s head puffed up by parasites, assume this unto himself, glorious titles, in worth an infant, a Cuman ass, a painted sepulchre, an Egyptian temple? To see a withered face, a diseased, deformed, cankered complexion, a rotten carcass, a viperous mind, and Epicurean soul set out with orient pearls, jewels, diadems, perfumes, curious elaborate works, as proud of his clothes as a child of his new coats; and a goodly person, of an angel-like divine countenance, a saint, an humble mind, a meet spirit clothed in rags, beg, and now ready to be starved? To see a silly contemptible sloven in apparel, ragged in his coat, polite in speech, of a divine spirit, wise? another neat in clothes, spruce, full of courtesy, empty of grace, wit, talk nonsense?</p>
<p>To see so many lawyers, advocates, so many tribunals, so little justice; so many magistrates, so little care of common good; so many laws, yet never more disorders; Tribunal litium segetem, the Tribunal a labyrinth, so many thousand suits in one court sometimes, so violently followed? To see injustissimum saepe juri praesidentem, impium religioni, imperitissimum eruditioni, otiosissimum labori, monstrosum humanitati? to see a lamb  Neque novum, neque mirum, neque secus quam alii solent. For in a great person, right worshipful Sir, a right honourable grandee, &#39;tis not a venial sin, no, not a peccadillo, &#39;tis no offence at all, a common and ordinary thing, no man takes notice of it; he justifies it in public, and peradventure brags of it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Nam quod turpe bonis, Titio, Seioque, decebat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crispinum———</p>
<p>For what would be base in good men, Titius, and Seius, became Crispinus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> How would Democritus have been affected to see these things!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see a man turn himself into all shapes like a chameleon, or as Proteus, omnia transformans sese in miracula rerum, to act twenty parts and persons at once, for his advantage, to temporise and vary like Mercury the planet, good with good; bad with bad; having a several face, garb, and character for every one he meets; of all religions, humours, inclinations; to fawn like a spaniel, mentitis et mimicis obsequis; rage like a lion, bark like a cur, fight like a dragon, sting like a serpent, as meek as a lamb, and yet again grin like a tiger, weep like a crocodile, insult over some, and yet others domineer over him, here command, there crouch, tyrannise in one place, be baffled in another, a wise man at home, a fool abroad to make others merry.</p>
<p>To see so much difference betwixt words and deeds, so many parasangs betwixt tongue and heart, men like stage-players act variety of parts,  give good precepts to others, soar aloft, whilst they themselves grovel on the ground.</p>
<p>To see a man protest friendship, kiss his hand,  magnify his friend unworthy with hyperbolical eulogiums; his enemy albeit a good man, to vilify and disgrace him, yea all his actions, with the utmost that livor and malice can invent.</p>
<p>To see a  land fed with chaff, an idle jade have provender in abundance; him that makes shoes go barefoot himself, him that sells meat almost pined; a toiling drudge starve, a drone flourish.</p>
<p>To see men buy smoke for wares, castles built with fools&#39; heads, men like apes follow the fashions in tires, gestures, actions: if the king laugh, all laugh;</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Rides? majore chachiano</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concutitur, flet si lachrymas conspexit amici.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Sabina Poppea, Nero&#39;s wife, wore amber-coloured hair, so did all the Roman ladies in an instant, her fashion was theirs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see men wholly led by affection, admired and censured out of opinion without judgment: an inconsiderate multitude, like so many dogs in a village, if one bark all bark without a cause: as fortune&#39;s fan turns, if a man be in favour, or commanded by some great one, all the world applauds him;  if in disgrace, in an instant all hate him, and as at the sun when he is eclipsed, that erst took no notice, now gaze and stare upon him.</p>
<p>To see a man  to eat one another.</p>
<p>To see a man roll himself up like a snowball, from base beggary to right worshipful and right honourable titles, unjustly to screw himself into honours and offices; another to starve his genius, damn his soul to gather wealth, which he shall not enjoy, which his prodigal son melts and consumes in an instant.  </p>
<p>To see the κακοζηλίαν of our times, a man bend all his forces, means, time, fortunes, to be a favorite&#39;s favorite&#39;s favorite, &amp;c., a parasite&#39;s parasite&#39;s parasite, that may scorn the servile world as having enough already.</p>
<p>To see an hirsute beggar&#39;s brat, that lately fed on scraps, crept and whined, crying to all, and for an old jerkin ran of errands, now ruffle in silk and satin, bravely mounted, jovial and polite, now scorn his old friends and familiars, neglect his kindred, insult over his betters, domineer over all.</p>
<p>To see a scholar crouch and creep to an illiterate peasant for a meal&#39;s meat; a scrivener better paid for an obligation; a falconer receive greater wages than a student; a lawyer get more in a day than a philosopher in a year, better reward for an hour, than a scholar for a twelvemonth&#39;s study; him that can  paint Thais, play on a fiddle, curl hair, &amp;c., sooner get preferment than a philologer or a poet.</p>
<p>To see a fond mother, like Aesop&#39;s ape, hug her child to death, a  denounce that in public which he doth in secret; and which Aurelius Victor gives out of Augustus, severely censure that in a third, of which he is most guilty himself.</p>
<p>To see a poor fellow, or an hired servant venture his life for his new master that will scarce give him his wages at year&#39;s end; A country colon toil and moil, till and drudge for a prodigal idle drone, that devours all the gain, or lasciviously consumes with fantastical expenses; A noble man in a bravado to encounter death, and for a small flash of honour to cast away himself; A worldling tremble at an executor, and yet not fear hell-fire; To wish and hope for immortality, desire to be happy, and yet by all means avoid death, a necessary passage to bring him to it.</p>
<p>To see a foolhardy fellow like those old Danes, qui decollari malunt quam verberari, die rather than be punished, in a sottish humour embrace death with alacrity, yet  scorn to lament his own sins and miseries, or his clearest friends&#39; departures.</p>
<p>To see wise men degraded, fools preferred, one govern towns and cities, and yet a silly woman overrules him at home;  sheep demolish towns, devour men, &amp;c. And in a word, the world turned upside downward. O viveret Democritus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> To insist in every particular were one of Hercules&#39; labours, there&#39;s so many ridiculous instances, as motes in the sun. Quantum est in rebus inane? (How much vanity there is in things!) And who can speak of all? Crimine ab uno disce omnes, take this for a taste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But these are obvious to sense, trivial and well known, easy to be discerned. How would Democritus have been moved, had he seen  the secrets of their hearts? If every man had a window in his breast, which Momus would have had in Vulcan&#39;s man, or that which Tully so much wished it were written in every man&#39;s forehead, Quid quisque de republica sentiret, what he thought; or that it could be effected in an instant, which Mercury did by Charon in Lucian, by touching of his eyes, to make him discern semel et simul rumores et susurros.</p>
<p>Spes hominum caecas, morbos, votumque labores,</p>
<p>Et passim toto volitantes aethere curas.</p>
<p>Blind hopes and wishes, their thoughts and affairs,</p>
<p>Whispers and rumours, and those flying cares.</p>
<p>That he could cubiculorum obductas foras recludere et secreta cordium penetrare, which  an acre of hellebore will not do it.</p>
<p>That which is more to be lamented, they are mad like Seneca&#39;s blind woman, and will not acknowledge, or  no notice taken of it.</p>
<p>Nimirum insanus paucis videatur; eo quod</p>
<p>Maxima pars hominum morbo jactatur eodem.</p>
<p>When all are mad, where all are like opprest</p>
<p>Who can discern one mad man from the rest?</p>
<p>But put case they do perceive it, and some one be manifestly convicted of madness,  a dog to his vomit, he returns to it again; no persuasion will take place, no counsel, say what thou canst,</p>
<p>Clames licet et mare coelo</p>
<p>——Confundas, surdo narras, </p>
<p>demonstrate as Ulysses did to  Orestes and Athamas, that they may go ride the ass, and all sail along to the Anticyrae, in the ship of fools for company together. I need not much labour to prove this which I say otherwise than thus, make any solemn protestation, or swear, I think you will believe me without an oath; say at a word, are they fools? I refer it to you, though you be likewise fools and madmen yourselves, and I as mad to ask the question; for what said our comical Mercury?</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Justum ab injustis petere insipientia est.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll stand to your censure yet, what think you?</p>
<p>But forasmuch as I undertook at first, that kingdoms, provinces, families, were melancholy as well as private men, I will examine them in particular, and that which I have hitherto dilated at random, in more general terms, I will particularly insist in, prove with more special and evident arguments, testimonies, illustrations, and that in brief.  Petronius, our country is so full of deified spirits, divine souls, that you may sooner find a God than a man amongst us, we think so well of ourselves, and that is an ample testimony of much folly.</p>
<p>My second argument is grounded upon the like place of Scripture, which though before mentioned in effect, yet for some reasons is to be repeated (and by Plato&#39;s good leave, I may do it,  Theodoret, out of Plotinus the Platonist, holds it a ridiculous thing for a man to live after his own laws, to do that which is offensive to God, and yet to hope that he should save him: and when he voluntarily neglects his own safety, and contemns the means, to think to be delivered by another: who will say these men are wise?</p>
<p>A third argument may be derived from the precedent,  Lactantius stiffly maintains, wisdom cannot dwell,</p>
<p>——qui cupiet, metuet quoque porro,</p>
<p>Qui metuens vivit, liber mihi non erit unquam. </p>
<p>Seneca and the rest of the stoics are of opinion, that where is any the least perturbation, wisdom may not be found. What more ridiculous, as  Chrysostom pleads farther yet, that they are more than mad, very beasts, stupefied and void of common sense: For how (saith he) shall I know thee to be a man, when thou kickest like an ass, neighest like a horse after women, ravest in lust like a bull, ravenest like a bear, stingest like a scorpion, rakest like a wolf, as subtle as a fox, as impudent as a dog? Shall I say thou art a man, that hast all the symptoms of a beast? How shall I know thee to be a man? by thy shape? That affrights me more, when I see a beast in likeness of a man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Seneca calls that of Epicurus, magnificam vocem, an heroical speech, A fool still begins to live, and accounts it a filthy lightness in men, every day to lay new foundations of their life, but who doth otherwise? One travels, another builds; one for this, another for that business, and old folks are as far out as the rest; O dementem senectutem, Tully exclaims. Therefore young, old, middle age, are all stupid, and dote.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> Aeneas Sylvius, amongst many other, sets down three special ways to find a fool by. He is a fool that seeks that he cannot find: he is a fool that seeks that, which being found will do him more harm than good: he is a fool, that having variety of ways to bring him to his journey&#39;s end, takes that which is worst. If so, methinks most men are fools; examine their courses, and you shall soon perceive what dizzards and mad men the major part are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beroaldus will have drunkards, afternoon men, and such as more than ordinarily delight in drink, to be mad. The first pot quencheth thirst, so Panyasis the poet determines in Athenaeus, secunda gratiis, horis et Dyonisio: the second makes merry, the third for pleasure, quarta, ad insaniam, the fourth makes them mad. If this position be true, what a catalogue of mad men shall we have? what shall they be that drink four times four? Nonne supra omnem furorem, supra omnem insanian reddunt insanissimos? I am of his opinion, they are more than mad, much worse than mad.</p>
<p>The   fleering and grinning there is in this age, they would certainly have concluded, we had been all out of our wits.</p>
<p>Aristotle in his Ethics holds felix idemque sapiens, to be wise and happy, are reciprocal terms, bonus idemque sapiens honestus. &#39;Tis   Tully&#39;s paradox, wise men are free, but fools are slaves, liberty is a power to live according to his own laws, as we will ourselves: who hath this liberty? who is free?</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———sapiens sibique imperiosus,</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Quem neque pauperis, neque mors, neque vincula terrent,
Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores
Fortis, et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus.
He is wise that can command his own will,
Valiant and constant to himself still,
Whom poverty nor death, nor bands can fright,
Checks his desires, scorns honours, just and right.</code></pre>
<p>But where shall such a man be found? If no where, then e diametro, we are all slaves, senseless, or worse. Nemo malus felix. But no man is happy in this life, none good, therefore no man wise.  Rari quippe boni——— For one virtue you shall find ten vices in the same party; pauci Promethei, multi Epimethei. We may peradventure usurp the name, or attribute it to others for favour, as Carolus Sapiens, Philippus Bonus, Lodovicus Pius, &amp;c., and describe the properties of a wise man, as Tully doth an orator, Xenophon Cyrus, Castilio a courtier, Galen temperament, an aristocracy is described by politicians. But where shall such a man be found?</p>
<p>Vir bonus et sapiens, qualem vix repperit unum</p>
<p>Millibus e multis hominum consultus Apollo.</p>
<p>A wise, a good man in a million,</p>
<p>Apollo consulted could scarce find one.</p>
<p>A man is a miracle of himself, but Trismegistus adds, Maximum miraculum homo sapiens, a wise man is a wonder: multi Thirsigeri, pauci Bacchi.</p>
<p>Alexander when he was presented with that rich and costly casket of king Darius, and every man advised him what to put in it, he reserved it to keep Homer&#39;s works, as the most precious jewel of human wit, and yet  and as he said of the Greeks, Vos Graeci semper pueri, vos Britanni, Galli, Germani, Itali, &amp;c. you are a company of fools.</p>
<p>Proceed now a partibus ad totum, or from the whole to parts, and you shall find no other issue, the parts shall be sufficiently dilated in this following Preface. The whole must needs follow by a sorites or induction. Every multitude is mad,  Roger Bacon proves it out of Aristotle, Vulgus dividi in oppositum contra sapientes, quod vulgo videtur verum, falsum est; that which the commonalty accounts true, is most part false, they are still opposite to wise men, but all the world is of this humour (vulgus), and thou thyself art de vulgo, one of the commonalty; and he, and he, and so are all the rest; and therefore, as Phocion concludes, to be approved in nought you say or do, mere idiots and asses. Begin then where you will, go backward or forward, choose out of the whole pack, wink and choose, you shall find them all alike, never a barrel better herring.</p>
<p>Copernicus, Atlas his successor, is of opinion, the earth is a planet, moves and shines to others, as the moon doth to us. Digges, Gilbert, Keplerus, Origanus, and others, defend this hypothesis of his in sober sadness, and that the moon is inhabited: if it be so that the earth is a moon, then are we also giddy, vertiginous and lunatic within this sublunary maze.</p>
<p>I could produce such arguments till dark night: if you should hear the rest,</p>
<p>Ante diem clauso component vesper Olimpo:</p>
<p>Through such a train of words if I should run,</p>
<p>The day would sooner than the tale be done:</p>
<p>but according to my promise, I will descend to particulars. This melancholy extends itself not to men only, but even to vegetals and sensibles. I speak not of those creatures which are saturnine, melancholy by nature, as lead, and such like minerals, or those plants, rue, cypress, &amp;c. and hellebore itself, of which  author.</p>
<p>Kingdoms, provinces, and politic bodies are likewise sensible and subject to this disease, as   Aristotle, Polit. lib. 3, cap. 4, calls Commune bonum, Polybius lib. 6, optabilem et selectum statum, that country is free from melancholy; as it was in Italy in the time of Augustus, now in China, now in many other flourishing kingdoms of Europe. But whereas you shall see many discontents, common grievances, complaints, poverty, barbarism, beggary, plagues, wars, rebellions, seditions, mutinies, contentions, idleness, riot, epicurism, the land lie untilled, waste, full of bogs, fens, deserts, &amp;c., cities decayed, base and poor towns, villages depopulated, the people squalid, ugly, uncivil; that kingdom, that country, must needs be discontent, melancholy, hath a sick body, and had need to be reformed.</p>
<p>Now that cannot well be effected, till the causes of these maladies be first removed, which commonly proceed from their own default, or some accidental inconvenience: as to be situated in a bad clime, too far north, sterile, in a barren place, as the desert of Libya, deserts of Arabia, places void of waters, as those of Lop and Belgian in Asia, or in a bad air, as at Alexandretta, Bantam, Pisa, Durrazzo, S. John de Ulloa, &amp;c., or in danger of the sea&#39;s continual inundations, as in many places of the Low Countries and elsewhere, or near some bad neighbours, as Hungarians to Turks, Podolians to Tartars, or almost any bordering countries, they live in fear still, and by reason of hostile incursions are oftentimes left desolate. So are cities by reason   Cyprian Echovius, a Spanish chorographer, above all other cities of Spain, commends Borcino, in which there was no beggar, no man poor, &amp;c., but all rich, and in good estate, and he gives the reason, because they were more religious than, their neighbours: why was Israel so often spoiled by their enemies, led into captivity, &amp;c., but for their idolatry, neglect of God&#39;s word, for sacrilege, even for one Achan&#39;s fault? And what shall we except that have such multitudes of Achans, church robbers, simoniacal patrons, &amp;c., how can they hope to flourish, that neglect divine duties, that live most part like Epicures?</p>
<p>Other common grievances are generally noxious to a body politic; alteration of laws and customs, breaking privileges, general oppressions, seditions, &amp;c., observed by  as a judicious countryman of ours observed not long since, in a survey of that great Duchy of Tuscany, the people lived much grieved and discontent, as appeared by their manifold and manifest complainings in that kind. That the state was like a sick body which had lately taken physic, whose humours are not yet well settled, and weakened so much by purging, that nothing was left but melancholy.</p>
<p>Whereas the princes and potentates are immoderate in lust, hypocrites, epicures, of no religion, but in show: Quid hypocrisi fragilius? what so brittle and unsure? what sooner subverts their estates than wandering and raging lusts, on their subjects&#39; wives, daughters? to say no worse. That they should facem praeferre, lead the way to all virtuous actions, are the ringleaders oftentimes of all mischief and dissolute courses, and by that means their countries are plagued,  and they themselves often ruined, banished, or murdered by conspiracy of their subjects, as Sardanapalus was, Dionysius Junior, Heliogabalus, Periander, Pisistratus, Tarquinius, Timocrates, Childericus, Appius Claudius, Andronicus, Galeacius Sforza, Alexander Medices, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Whereas the princes or great men are malicious, envious, factious, ambitious, emulators, they tear a commonwealth asunder, as so many Guelfs and Gibelines disturb the quietness of it,  and with mutual murders let it bleed to death; our histories are too full of such barbarous inhumanities, and the miseries that issue from them.</p>
<p>Whereas they be like so many horseleeches, hungry, griping, corrupt,  old philosopher affirms, such men are not always fit. Of an infinite number, few alone are senators, and of those few, fewer good, and of that small number of honest, good, and noble men, few that are learned, wise, discreet and sufficient, able to discharge such places, it must needs turn to the confusion of a state.</p>
<p>For as the  Antigonus right well said of old, qui Macedonia regem erudit, omnes etiam subditos erudit, he that teacheth the king of Macedon, teacheth all his subjects, is a true saying still.</p>
<p>For Princes are the glass, the school, the book,</p>
<p>Where subjects&#39; eyes do learn, do read, do look.</p>
<p>——Velocius et citius nos</p>
<p>Corrumpunt vitiorum exempla domestica, magnis</p>
<p>Cum subeant animos auctoribus.——— </p>
<p>Their examples are soonest followed, vices entertained, if they be profane, irreligious, lascivious, riotous, epicures, factious, covetous, ambitious, illiterate, so will the commons most part be, idle, unthrifts, prone to lust, drunkards, and therefore poor and needy (ἡ πενια στάσιν ἐμποιει καὶ κακουργίαν, for poverty begets sedition and villainy) upon all occasions ready to mutiny and rebel, discontent still, complaining, murmuring, grudging, apt to all outrages, thefts, treasons, murders, innovations, in debt, shifters, cozeners, outlaws, Profligatae famae ac vitae. It was an old  politician&#39;s aphorism, They that are poor and bad envy rich, hate good men, abhor the present government, wish for a new, and would have all turned topsy-turvy. When Catiline rebelled in Rome, he got a company of such debauched rogues together, they were his familiars and coadjutors, and such have been your rebels most part in all ages, Jack Cade, Tom Straw, Kette, and his companions.</p>
<p>Where they be generally riotous and contentious, where there be many discords, many laws, many lawsuits, many lawyers and many physicians, it is a manifest sign of a distempered, melancholy state, as  Agree with thine adversary quickly, &amp;c. Matth. v. 25.</p>
<p>I could repeat many such particular grievances, which must disturb a body politic. To shut up all in brief, where good government is, prudent and wise princes, there all things thrive and prosper, peace and happiness is in that land: where it is otherwise, all things are ugly to behold, incult, barbarous, uncivil, a paradise is turned to a wilderness. This island amongst the rest, our next neighbours the French and Germans, may be a sufficient witness, that in a short time by that prudent policy of the Romans, was brought from barbarism; see but what Caesar reports of us, and Tacitus of those old Germans, they were once as uncivil as they in Virginia, yet by planting of colonies and good laws, they became from barbarous outlaws,  so many navigable channels from place to place, made by men&#39;s hands, &amp;c. and on the other side so many thousand acres of our fens lie drowned, our cities thin, and those vile, poor, and ugly to behold in respect of theirs, our trades decayed, our still running rivers stopped, and that beneficial use of transportation, wholly neglected, so many havens void of ships and towns, so many parks and forests for pleasure, barren heaths, so many villages depopulated, &amp;c. I think sure he would find some fault.</p>
<p>I may not deny but that this nation of ours, doth bene audire apud exteros, is a most noble, a most flourishing kingdom, by common consent of all  fortified by art, and nature, and now most happy in that fortunate union of England and Scotland, which our forefathers have laboured to effect, and desired to see. But in which we excel all others, a wise, learned, religious king, another Numa, a second Augustus, a true Josiah; most worthy senators, a learned clergy, an obedient commonalty, &amp;c. Yet amongst many roses, some thistles grow, some bad weeds and enormities, which much disturb the peace of this body politic, eclipse the honour and glory of it, fit to be rooted out, and with all speed to be reformed.</p>
<p>The first is idleness, by reason of which we have many swarms of rogues, and beggars, thieves, drunkards, and discontented persons (whom Lycurgus in Plutarch calls morbos reipublicae, the boils of the commonwealth), many poor people in all our towns. Civitates ignobiles, as  Dion, mend a bad pasture.</p>
<p>Tell me politicians, why is that fruitful Palestina, noble Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, so much decayed, and (mere carcases now) fallen from that they were? The ground is the same, but the government is altered, the people are grown slothful, idle, their good husbandry, policy, and industry is decayed. Non fatigata aut effaeta, humus, as  Livy, not then so strong and puissant as of old: They mustered 70 Legions in former times, which now the known world will scarce yield. Alexander built 70 cities in a short space for his part, our sultans and Turks demolish twice as many, and leave all desolate. Many will not believe but that our island of Great Britain is now more populous than ever it was; yet let them read Bede, Leland and others, they shall find it most flourished in the Saxon Heptarchy, and in the Conqueror&#39;s time was far better inhabited, than at this present. See that Doomsday Book, and show me those thousands of parishes, which are now decayed, cities ruined, villages depopulated, &amp;c. The lesser the territory is, commonly, the richer it is. Parvus sed bene cultus ager. As those Athenian, Lacedaemonian, Arcadian, Aelian, Sycionian, Messenian, &amp;c. commonwealths of Greece make ample proof, as those imperial cities and free states of Germany may witness, those Cantons of Switzers, Rheti, Grisons, Walloons, Territories of Tuscany, Luke and Senes of old, Piedmont, Mantua, Venice in Italy, Ragusa, &amp;c.</p>
<p>That prince therefore as,  Mare liberum, they fish under our noses, and sell it to us when they have done, at their own prices.</p>
<p>——Pudet haec opprobria nobis</p>
<p>Et dici potuisse, et non potuisse refelli.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to hear this objected by strangers, and know not how to answer it.</p>
<p>Amongst our towns, there is only  some few excepted) are in mean estate, ruinous most part, poor, and full of beggars, by reason of their decayed trades, neglected or bad policy, idleness of their inhabitants, riot, which had rather beg or loiter, and be ready to starve, than work.</p>
<p>I cannot deny but that something may be said in defence of our cities,  as a bad humour from the body, that are like so many ulcers and boils, and must be cured before the melancholy body can be eased.</p>
<p>What Carolus Magnus, the Chinese, the Spaniards, the duke of Saxony and many other states have decreed in this case, read Arniseus, cap. 19; Boterus, libro 8, cap. 2; Osorius de Rubus gest. Eman. lib. 11. When a country is overstocked with people, as a pasture is oft overlaid with cattle, they had wont in former times to disburden themselves, by sending out colonies, or by wars, as those old Romans; or by employing them at home about some public buildings, as bridges, roadways, for which those Romans were famous in this island; as Augustus Caesar did in Rome, the Spaniards in their Indian mines, as at Potosi in Peru, where some 30,000 men are still at work, 6000 furnaces ever boiling, &amp;c.  Quo scilicet alantur et ne vagando laborare desuescant.</p>
<p>Another eyesore is that want of conduct and navigable rivers, a great blemish as  Gotardus Arthus relate; about Barcelona, Segovia, Murcia, and many other places of Spain, Milan in Italy; by reason of which, their soil is much impoverished, and infinite commodities arise to the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The Turks of late attempted to cut that Isthmus betwixt Africa and Asia, which  Diodorus writes, Ptolemy renewed the work many years after, and absolved in it a more opportune place.</p>
<p>That Isthmus of Corinth was likewise undertaken to be made navigable by Demetrius, by Julius Caesar, Nero, Domitian, Herodes Atticus, to make a speedy  Verulamium, good ships have formerly come to Exeter, and many such places, whose channels, havens, ports are now barred and rejected. We contemn this benefit of carriage by waters, and are therefore compelled in the inner parts of this island, because portage is so dear, to eat up our commodities ourselves, and live like so many boars in a sty, for want of vent and utterance.</p>
<p>We have many excellent havens, royal havens, Falmouth, Portsmouth, Milford, &amp;c. equivalent if not to be preferred to that Indian Havana, old Brundusium in Italy, Aulis in Greece, Ambracia in Acarnia, Suda in Crete, which have few ships in them, little or no traffic or trade, which have scarce a village on them, able to bear great cities, sed viderint politici. I could here justly tax many other neglects, abuses, errors, defects among us, and in other countries, depopulations, riot, drunkenness, &amp;c. and many such, quae nunc in aurem susurrare, non libet. But I must take heed, ne quid gravius dicam, that I do not overshoot myself, Sus Minervam, I am forth of my element, as you peradventure suppose; and sometimes veritas odium parit, as he said, verjuice and oatmeal is good for a parrot. For as Lucian said of an historian, I say of a politician. He that will freely speak and write, must be for ever no subject, under no prince or law, but lay out the matter truly as it is, not caring what any can, will, like or dislike.</p>
<p>We have good laws, I deny not, to rectify such enormities, and so in all other countries, but it seems not always to good purpose. We had need of some general visitor in our age, that should reform what is amiss; a just army of Rosy-cross men, for they will amend all matters (they say) religion, policy, manners, with arts, sciences, &amp;c. Another Attila, Tamerlane, Hercules, to strive with Achelous, Augeae stabulum purgare, to subdue tyrants, as  Bocchalinus may cite commonwealths to come before Apollo, and seek to reform the world itself by commissioners, but there is no remedy, it may not be redressed, desinent homines tum demum stultescere quando esse desinent, so long as they can wag their beards, they will play the knaves and fools.</p>
<p>Because, therefore, it is a thing so difficult, impossible, and far beyond Hercules labours to be performed; let them be rude, stupid, ignorant, incult, lapis super lapidem sedeat, and as the  hic segetes veniunt, illic felicius uvae, arborei foetus alibi, atque injussa virescunt Gramina, and what proportion is fit for all callings, because private professors are many times idiots, ill husbands, oppressors, covetous, and know not how to improve their own, or else wholly respect their own, and not public good.</p>
<p>Utopian parity is a kind of government, to be wished for,  procurator&#39;s houses and offices in Venice, which, like the golden apple, shall be given to the worthiest, and best deserving both in war and peace, as a reward of their worth and good service, as so many goals for all to aim at, (honos alit artes) and encouragements to others. For I hate these severe, unnatural, harsh, German, French, and Venetian decrees, which exclude plebeians from honours, be they never so wise, rich, virtuous, valiant, and well qualified, they must not be patricians, but keep their own rank, this is naturae bellum inferre, odious to God and men, I abhor it. My form of government shall be monarchical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> nunquam libertas gratior extat,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quam sub Rege pio, &amp;c.</p>
<p>few laws, but those severely kept, plainly put down, and in the mother tongue, that every man may understand. Every city shall have a peculiar trade or privilege, by which it shall be chiefly maintained:  Sesellius would have and so much desires in his kingdom of France, a diapason and sweet harmony of kings, princes, nobles, and plebeians so mutually tied and involved in love, as well as laws and authority, as that they never disagree, insult, or encroach one upon another. If any man deserve well in his office he shall be rewarded.</p>
<p>——quis enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam,</p>
<p>Proemia si tollas?——— </p>
<p>He that invents anything for public good in any art or science, writes a treatise,  honoured, and preferred. I say with Hannibal in Ennius, Hostem qui feriet erit mihi Carthaginensis, let him be of what condition he will, in all offices, actions, he that deserves best shall have best.</p>
<p>Tilianus in Philonius, out of a charitable mind no doubt, wished all his books were gold and silver, jewels and precious stones,  Ammianus, impendio formidatas et abominandas leges, per quas ob noxam unius, omnis propinquitas perit hard law that wife and children, friends and allies, should suffer for the father&#39;s offence.</p>
<p>No man shall marry until he  colonies.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I will have no private monopolies, to enrich one man, and beggar a multitude,   temere, ne quid remisse ac timide fiat; Sid quo feror hospes? To prosecute the rest would require a volume. Manum de tabella, I have been over tedious in this subject; I could have here willingly ranged, but these straits wherein I am included will not permit.</p>
<p>From commonwealths and cities, I will descend to families, which have as many corsives and molestations, as frequent discontents as the rest. Great affinity there is betwixt a political and economical body; they differ only in magnitude and proportion of business (so Scaliger  servi furaces, Versipelles, callidi, occlusa sibi mille clavibus reserant, furtimque; raptant, consumunt, liguriunt; casualties, taxes, mulcts, chargeable offices, vain expenses, entertainments, loss of stock, enmities, emulations, frequent invitations, losses, suretyship, sickness, death of friends, and that which is the gulf of all, improvidence, ill husbandry, disorder and confusion, by which means they are drenched on a sudden in their estates, and at unawares precipitated insensibly into an inextricable labyrinth of debts, cares, woes, want, grief, discontent and melancholy itself.</p>
<p>I have done with families, and will now briefly run over some few sorts and conditions of men. The most secure, happy, jovial, and merry in the world&#39;s esteem are princes and great men, free from melancholy: but for their cares, miseries, suspicions, jealousies, discontents, folly and madness, I refer you to Xenophon&#39;s Tyrannus, where king Hieron discourseth at large with Simonides the poet, of this subject. Of all others they are most troubled with perpetual fears, anxieties, insomuch, that as he said in  of reason too oft, and precipitate in their actions, read all our histories, quos de stultis prodidere stulti, Iliades, Aeneides, Annales, and what is the subject?</p>
<p>Stultorum regum, et populorum continet aestus.</p>
<p>The giddy tumults and the foolish rage</p>
<p>Of kings and people.</p>
<p>How mad they are, how furious, and upon small occasions, rash and inconsiderate in their proceedings, how they dote, every page almost will witness,</p>
<p>——delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi.</p>
<p>When doting monarchs urge</p>
<p>Unsound resolves, their subjects feel the scourge.</p>
<p>Next in place, next in miseries and discontents, in all manner of hair-brain actions, are great men, procul a Jove, procul a fulmine, the nearer the worse. If they live in court, they are up and down, ebb and flow with their princes&#39; favours, Ingenium vultu statque caditque suo, now aloft, tomorrow down, as  Aeneas Sylvius (libidinis et stultitiae servos, he calls them), Agrippa, and many others.</p>
<p>Of philosophers and scholars priscae sapientiae dictatores, I have already spoken in general terms, those superintendents of wit and learning, men above men, those refined men, minions of the muses,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ———mentemque habere queis bonam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Et esse  corculis datum est.———</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Scaliger; and who doth not? Aut insanit homo, aut versus facit (He&#39;s mad or making verses), Hor. Sat. vii. l. 2. Insanire lubet, i. versus componere. Virg. 3 Ecl.; so Servius interprets it, all poets are mad, a company of bitter satirists, detractors, or else parasitical applauders: and what is poetry itself, but as Austin holds, Vinum erroris ab ebriis doctoribus propinatum? You may give that censure of them in general, which Sir Thomas More once did of Germanus Brixius&#39; poems in particular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>——vehuntur</p>
<p>In rate stultitiae sylvam habitant Furiae. </p>
<p>Budaeus, in an epistle of his to Lupsetus, will have civil law to be the tower of wisdom; another honours physic, the quintessence of nature; a third tumbles them both down, and sets up the flag of his own peculiar science. Your supercilious critics, grammatical triflers, note-makers, curious antiquaries, find out all the ruins of wit, ineptiarum delicias, amongst the rubbish of old writers;   Seneca esteems of them, to make doubts and scruples, how to read them truly, to mend old authors, but will not mend their own lives, or teach us ingevia sanare, memoriam officiorum ingerere, ac fidem in rebus humanis retinere, to keep our wits in order, or rectify our manners. Numquid tibi demens videtur, si istis operam impenderit? Is not he mad that draws lines with Archimedes, whilst his house is ransacked, and his city besieged, when the whole world is in combustion, or we whilst our souls are in danger, (mors sequitur, vita fugit) to spend our time in toys, idle questions, and things of no worth?</p>
<p>That  lovers are mad, I think no man will deny, Amare simul et sapere, ipsi Jovi non datur, Jupiter himself cannot intend both at once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Non bene conveniunt, nec in una sede morantur</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Majestas et amor.</p>
<p>Tully, when he was invited to a second marriage, replied, he could not simul amare et sapere be wise and love both together.  Seneca calls it, an impotent and raging lust. I shall dilate this subject apart; in the meantime let lovers sigh out the rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Aristotle observes, ubi mens plurima, ibi minima fortuna, ubi plurima fortuna, ibi mens perexigua, great wealth and little wit go commonly together: they have as much brains some of them in their heads as in their heels; besides this inbred neglect of liberal sciences, and all arts, which should excolere mentem, polish the mind, they have most part some gullish humour or other, by which they are led; one is an Epicure, an Atheist, a second a gamester, a third a whoremaster (fit subjects all for a satirist to work upon);</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> Hic nuptarum insanit amoribus, hic puerorum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One burns to madness for the wedded dame;</p>
<p>Unnatural lusts another&#39;s heart inflame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Berosus of Semiramis; omnes mortales militia triumphis, divitiis, &amp;c., tum et luxu, caede, caeterisque vitiis antecessit, as she had some good, so had she many bad parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexander, a worthy man, but furious in his anger, overtaken in drink: Caesar and Scipio valiant and wise, but vainglorious, ambitious: Vespasian a worthy prince, but covetous:  Hannibal, as he had mighty virtues, so had he many vices; unam virtutem mille vitia comitantur, as Machiavel of Cosmo de Medici, he had two distinct persons in him. I will determine of them all, they are like these double or turning pictures; stand before which you see a fair maid, on the one side an ape, on the other an owl; look upon them at the first sight, all is well, but farther examine, you shall find them wise on the one side, and fools on the other; in some few things praiseworthy, in the rest incomparably faulty. I will say nothing of their diseases, emulations, discontents, wants, and such miseries: let poverty plead the rest in Aristophanes&#39; Plutus.</p>
<p>Covetous men, amongst others, are most mad,  they have all the symptoms of melancholy, fear, sadness, suspicion, &amp;c., as shall be proved in its proper place,</p>
<p>Danda est Hellebori multo pars maxima avaris.</p>
<p>Misers make Anticyra their own;</p>
<p>Its hellebore reserved for them alone.</p>
<p>And yet methinks prodigals are much madder than they, be of what condition they will, that bear a public or private purse; as a  all they that cannot keep, disburse, or spend their moneys well.</p>
<p>I might say the like of angry, peevish, envious, ambitious;  lascivious; I can feel their pulses beat hither; horn-mad some of them, to let others lie with their wives, and wink at it.</p>
<p>To insist  betrothed to wisdom, if we may believe their disciples and followers. I must needs except Lipsius and the Pope, and expunge their name out of the catalogue of fools. For besides that parasitical testimony of Dousa,</p>
<p>A Sole exoriente Maeotidas usque paludes,</p>
<p>Nemo est qui justo se aequiparare queat. </p>
<p>Lipsius saith of himself, that he was  his parrots often make him, a demigod, and besides his holiness cannot err, in Cathedra belike: and yet some of them have been magicians, Heretics, Atheists, children, and as Platina saith of John 22, Et si vir literatus, multa stoliditatem et laevitatem prae se ferentia egit, stolidi et socordis vir ingenii, a scholar sufficient, yet many things he did foolishly, lightly. I can say no more than in particular, but in general terms to the rest, they are all mad, their wits are evaporated, and, as Ariosto feigns, l. 34, kept in jars above the moon.</p>
<p>Some lose their wits with love, some with ambition,</p>
<p>Some following  Lords and men of high condition.</p>
<p>Some in fair jewels rich and costly set,</p>
<p>Others in Poetry their wits forget.</p>
<p>Another thinks to be an Alchemist,</p>
<p>Till all be spent, and that his number&#39;s mist.</p>
<p>Convicted fools they are, madmen upon record; and I am afraid past cure many of them,  crepunt inguina, the symptoms are manifest, they are all of Gotam parish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Quum furor haud dubius, quum sit manifesta phrenesis,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since madness is indisputable, since frenzy is obvious.</p>
<p>what remains then  but to send for Lorarios, those officers to carry them all together for company to Bedlam, and set Rabelais to be their physician.</p>
<p>If any man shall ask in the meantime, who I am that so boldly censure others, tu nullane habes vitia? have I no faults?  Yes, more than thou hast, whatsoever thou art. Nos numerus sumus, I confess it again, I am as foolish, as mad as any one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Insanus vobis videor, non deprecor ipse,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quo minus insanus,———</p>
<p>I do not deny it, demens de populo dematur. My comfort is, I have more fellows, and those of excellent note. And though I be not so right or so discreet as I should be, yet not so mad, so bad neither, as thou perhaps takest me to be.</p>
<p>To conclude, this being granted, that all the world is melancholy, or mad, dotes, and every member of it, I have ended my task, and sufficiently illustrated that which I took upon me to demonstrate at first. At this present I have no more to say; His sanam mentem Democritus, I can but wish myself and them a good physician, and all of us a better mind.</p>
<p>And although for the above-named reasons, I had a just cause to undertake this subject, to point at these particular species of dotage, that so men might acknowledge their imperfections, and seek to reform what is amiss; yet I have a more serious intent at this time; and to omit all impertinent digressions, to say no more of such as are improperly melancholy, or metaphorically mad, lightly mad, or in disposition, as stupid, angry, drunken, silly, sottish, sullen, proud, vainglorious, ridiculous, beastly, peevish, obstinate, impudent, extravagant, dry, doting, dull, desperate, harebrain, &amp;c. mad, frantic, foolish, heteroclites, which no new  Julius Caesar Claudinus calls it the fountain of all other diseases, and so common in this crazed age of ours, that scarce one of a thousand is free from it; and that splenetic hypochondriacal wind especially, which proceeds from the spleen and short ribs. Being then a disease so grievous, so common, I know not wherein to do a more general service, and spend my time better, than to prescribe means how to prevent and cure so universal a malady, an epidemical disease, that so often, so much crucifies the body and mind.</p>
<p>If I have overshot myself in this which hath been hitherto said, or that it is, which I am sure some will object, too fantastical, too light and comical for a Divine, too satirical for one of my profession, I will presume to answer with  Erasmus, in like case, &#39;tis not I, but Democritus, Democritus dixit: you must consider what it is to speak in one&#39;s own or another&#39;s person, an assumed habit and name; a difference betwixt him that affects or acts a prince&#39;s, a philosopher&#39;s, a magistrate&#39;s, a fool&#39;s part, and him that is so indeed; and what liberty those old satirists have had; it is a cento collected from others; not I, but they that say it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Dixero si quid forte jocosius, hoc mihi juris</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cum venia, dabis———</p>
<p>Yet some indulgence I may justly claim,</p>
<p>If too familiar with another&#39;s fame.</p>
<p>Take heed you mistake me not. If I do a little forget myself, I hope you will pardon it. And to say truth, why should any man be offended, or take exceptions at it?</p>
<p>Licuit, semperque licebit,</p>
<p>Parcere personis, dicere de vitiis.</p>
<p>It lawful was of old, and still will be,</p>
<p>To speak of vice, but let the name go free.</p>
<p>I hate their vices, not their persons. If any be displeased, or take aught unto himself, let him not expostulate or cavil with him that said it (so did  if he be guilty and deserve it, let him amend, whoever he is, and not be angry. He that hateth correction is a fool, Prov. xii. 1. If he be not guilty, it concerns him not; it is not my freeness of speech, but a guilty conscience, a galled back of his own that makes him wince.</p>
<p>Suspicione si quis errabit sua,</p>
<p>Et rapiet ad se, quod erit commune omnium,</p>
<p>Stulte nudabit animi conscientiam. </p>
<p>I deny not this which I have said savours a little of Democritus;  Vacuna, and sat tippling by their Vacunal fires. I writ this, and published this οὕτις ἕλεγεν, it is neminis nihil. The time, place, persons, and all circumstances apologise for me, and why may not I then be idle with others? speak my mind freely? If you deny me this liberty, upon these presumptions I will take it: I say again, I will take it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Si quis est qui dictum in se inclementius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Existimavit esse, sic existimet.</p>
<p>If any man take exceptions, let him turn the buckle of his girdle, I care not. I owe thee nothing (Reader), I look for no favour at thy hands, I am independent, I fear not.</p>
<p>No, I recant, I will not, I care, I fear, I confess my fault, acknowledge a great offence,</p>
<p>——motos praestat componere fluctus.</p>
<p>——let&#39;s first assuage the troubled waves</p>
<p>I have overshot myself, I have spoken foolishly, rashly, unadvisedly, absurdly, I have anatomised mine own folly. And now methinks upon a sudden I am awaked as it were out of a dream; I have had a raving fit, a fantastical fit, ranged up and down, in and out, I have insulted over the most kind of men, abused some, offended others, wronged myself; and now being recovered, and perceiving mine error, cry with  Orlando, Solvite me, pardon (o boni) that which is past, and I will make you amends in that which is to come; I promise you a more sober discourse in my following treatise.</p>
<p>If through weakness, folly, passion,  They fear a satirist&#39;s wit, he their memories. I may justly suspect the worst; and though I hope I have wronged no man, yet in Medea&#39;s words I will crave pardon,</p>
<p>——Illud jam voce extrema peto,</p>
<p>Ne si qua noster dubius effudit dolor,</p>
<p>Maneant in animo verba, sed melior tibi</p>
<p>Memoria nostri subeat, haec irae data</p>
<p>Obliterentur———</p>
<p>And in my last words this I do desire,</p>
<p>That what in passion I have said, or ire,</p>
<p>May be forgotten, and a better mind,</p>
<p>Be had of us, hereafter as you find.</p>
<p>I earnestly request every private man, as Scaliger did Cardan, not to take offence. I will conclude in his lines, Si me cognitum haberes, non solum donares nobis has facetias nostras, sed etiam indignum duceres, tam humanum aninum, lene ingenium, vel minimam suspicionem deprecari oportere. If thou knewest my  Nemo aliquid recognoscat, nos mentimur omnia. I&#39;ll deny all (my last refuge), recant all, renounce all I have said, if any man except, and with as much facility excuse, as he can accuse; but I presume of thy good favour, and gracious acceptance (gentle reader). Out of an assured hope and confidence thereof, I will begin.</p>
<p>LECTORI MALE FERIATO.</p>
<p>Tu vero cavesis edico quisquis es, ne temere sugilles Auctorem hujusce operis, aut cavillator irrideas. Imo ne vel ex aliorum censura tacite obloquaris (vis dicam verbo) nequid nasutulus inepte improbes, aut falso fingas. Nam si talis revera sit, qualem prae se fert Junior Democritus, seniori Democrito saltem affinis, aut ejus Genium vel tantillum sapiat; actum de te, censorem aeque ac delatorem  aget econtra (petulanti splene cum sit) sufflabit te in jocos, comminuet in sales, addo etiam, et deo risui te sacrificabit.</p>
<p>Iterum moneo, ne quid cavillere, ne dum Democritum Juniorem conviciis infames, aut ignominiose vituperes, de te non male sentientem, tu idem audias ab amico cordato, quod olim vulgus Abderitanum ab   Hippocrate, concivem bene meritum et popularem suum Democritum, pro insano habens. Ne tu Democrite sapis, stulti autem et insani Abderitae.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Abderitanae pectora plebis habes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haec te paucis admonitum volo (male feriate Lector) abi.</p>
<h3>TO THE READER AT LEISURE.</h3>
<p>Whoever you may be, I caution you against rashly defaming the author of this work, or cavilling in jest against him. Nay, do not silently reproach him in consequence of others&#39; censure, nor employ your wit in foolish disapproval, or false accusation. For, should Democritus Junior prove to be what he professes, even a kinsman of his elder namesake, or be ever so little of the same kidney, it is all over with you: he will become both accuser and judge of you in your spleen, will dissipate you in jests, pulverise you into salt, and sacrifice you, I can promise you, to the God of Mirth.</p>
<p>I further advise you, not to asperse, or calumniate, or slander, Democritus Junior, who possibly does not think ill of you, lest you may hear from some discreet friend, the same remark the people of Abdera did from Hippocrates, of their meritorious and popular fellow-citizen, whom they had looked on as a madman; It is not that you, Democritus, that art wise, but that the people of Abdera are fools and madmen. You have yourself an Abderitian soul; and having just given you, gentle reader, these few words of admonition, farewell.</p>
<pre><code>Heraclite fleas, misero sic convenit aevo,
Nil nisi turpe vides, nil nisi triste vides.
Ride etiam, quantumque lubet, Democrite ride
Non nisi vana vides, non nisi stulta vides.
Is fletu, his risu modo gaudeat, unus utrique
Sit licet usque labor, sit licet usque dolor.
Nunc opes est (nam totus eheu jam desipit orbis)
Mille Heraclitis, milleque Democritis.
Nunc opus est (tanta est insania) transeat omnis
Mundus in Anticyras, gramen in Helleborum.
Weep, O Heraclitus, it suits the age,
Unless you see nothing base, nothing sad.
Laugh, O Democritus, as much as you please,
Unless you see nothing either vain or foolish.
Let one rejoice in smiles, the other in tears;
Let the same labour or pain be the office of both.
Now (for alas! how foolish the world has become),
A thousand Heraclitus&#39;, a thousand Democritus&#39; are required.
Now (so much does madness prevail), all the world must be
Sent to Anticyra, to graze on Hellebore.</code></pre><hr>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>His elder brother was William Burton, the Leicestershire antiquary, born 24th August, 1575, educated at Sutton Coldfield, admitted commoner, or gentleman commoner, of Brazen Nose College, 1591; at the Inner Temple, 20th May, 1593; B. A. 22d June, 1594; and afterwards a barrister and reporter in the Court of Common Pleas. But his natural genius, says Wood, leading him to the studies of heraldry, genealogies, and antiquities, he became excellent in those obscure and intricate matters; and look upon him as a gentleman, was accounted, by all that knew him, to be the best of his time for those studies, as may appear by his &#39;Description of Leicestershire.&#39; His weak constitution not permitting him to follow business, he retired into the country, and his greatest work, The Description of Leicestershire, was published in folio, 1623. He died at Falde, after suffering much in the civil war, 6th April, 1645, and was buried in the parish church belonging thereto, called Hanbury.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is Wood&#39;s account. His will says, Nuneaton; but a passage in this work [see fol. 304,] mentions Sutton Coldfield; probably he may have been at both schools.</p>

<li><p>So in the Register.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Originating, perhaps, in a note, p. 448, 6th edit. (p. 455 of the present), in which a book is quoted as having been printed at Paris 1624, <em>seven</em> years after Burton&#39;s first edition. As, however, the editions after that of 1621, are regularly marked in succession to the eighth, printed in 1676, there seems very little reason to doubt that, in the note above alluded to, either 1624 has been a misprint for 1628, or <em>seven</em> years for <em>three</em> years. The numerous typographical errata in other parts of the work strongly aid this latter supposition.</p>

Carew, in his survey of Cornwall, saith that before that country was enclosed, the husbandmen drank water, did eat little or no bread, fol. 66, lib. 1. their apparel was coarse, they went bare legged, their dwelling was correspondent; but since inclosure, they live decently, and have money to spend (fol. 23); when their fields were common, their wool was coarse, Cornish hair; but since inclosure, it is almost as good as Cotswol, and their soil much mended. Tusser. cap. 52 of his husbandry, is of his opinion, one acre enclosed, is worth three common. The country enclosed I praise; the other delighteth not me, for nothing of wealth it doth raise, &amp;c.</p>
