The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, earthly and devilish, as James calls it, iii. 15. They were vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was full of darkness, Rom. i. 21, 22. When they professed themselves wise, became fools. Their witty works are admired here on earth, whilst their souls are tormented in hell fire. In some sense, Christiani Crassiani, Christians are Crassians, and if compared to that wisdom, no better than fools. Quis est sapiens? Solus Deus,  Vitam regit fortuna, non sapientia.</p><p>When  Tully, I see everything to be done foolishly and unadvisedly.</p><p>Ille sinistrorsum, hic dextrorsum, unus utrique</p><p>Error, sed variis illudit partibus omnes.</p><p>One reels to this, another to that wall,</p></div> </div>
