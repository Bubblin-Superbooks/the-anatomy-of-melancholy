(Though others do it commonly)
Made him do this: if you must know,
The Printer would needs have it so.
Then do not frown or scoff at it,
Deride not, or detract a whit.

As thou lik'st it, so it likes thee.
And I for it will stand in view,
Thine to command, Reader, adieu.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
