<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>To see a poor fellow, or an hired servant venture his life for his new master that will scarce give him his wages at year's end; A country colon toil and moil, till and drudge for a prodigal idle drone, that devours all the gain, or lasciviously consumes with fantastical expenses; A noble man in a bravado to encounter death, and for a small flash of honour to cast away himself; A worldling tremble at an executor, and yet not fear hell-fire; To wish and hope for immortality, desire to be happy, and yet by all means avoid death, a necessary passage to bring him to it.</p><p>To see a foolhardy fellow like those old Danes, qui decollari malunt quam verberari, die rather than be punished, in a sottish humour embrace death with alacrity, yet  scorn to lament his own sins and miseries, or his clearest friends' departures.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To see wise men degraded, fools preferred, one govern towns and cities, and yet a silly woman overrules</p></div> </div>
