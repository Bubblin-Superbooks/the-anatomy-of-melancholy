Wind in his side doth him much harm,
And troubles him full sore, God knows,
Much pain he hath and many woes.
About him pots and glasses lie,
Newly brought from's Apothecary.

You see them portray'd in the sky.</code></pre><hr class="section"><p>VI.</p><pre class="  "><code>Beneath them kneeling on his knee,
A superstitious man you see:

Tormented hope and fear betwixt:
For Hell perhaps he takes more pain,
Than thou dost Heaven itself to</pre></div> </div>
