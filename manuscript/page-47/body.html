<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">ire,
Be ever courteous should the case allowâ€”
Sweet malt is ever made by gentle fire:
Warm to thy friends, give all a civil bow.
Even censure sometimes teaches to improve,
Slight frosts have often cured too rank a crop,
So, candid blame my spleen shall never move,
For skilful gard'ners wayward branches lop.
Go then, my book, and bear my words in mind;
Guides safe at once, and pleasant them you'll find.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
