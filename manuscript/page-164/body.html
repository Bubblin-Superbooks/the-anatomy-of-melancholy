You have yourself an Abderitian soul; and having just given you, gentle reader, these few words of admonition, farewell.</p><pre class="  "><code>Heraclite fleas, misero sic convenit aevo,
Nil nisi turpe vides, nil nisi triste vides.
Ride etiam, quantumque lubet, Democrite ride
Non nisi vana vides, non nisi stulta vides.
Is fletu, his risu modo gaudeat, unus utrique
Sit licet usque labor, sit licet usque</pre></div> </div>
