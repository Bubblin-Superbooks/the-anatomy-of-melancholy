For in a great person, right worshipful Sir, a right honourable grandee, 'tis not a venial sin, no, not a peccadillo, 'tis no offence at all, a common and ordinary thing, no man takes notice of it; he justifies it in public, and peradventure brags of it,</p><blockquote><p> Nam quod turpe bonis, Titio, Seioque, decebat</p></blockquote></div> </div>
