<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">to Donat, such as were desperate in wars, and precipitately made away themselves, (like those Celts in Damascen, with ridiculous valour, ut dedecorosum putarent muro ruenti se subducere, a disgrace to run away for a rotten wall, now ready to fall on their heads,) such as will not rush on a sword's point, or seek to shun a cannon's shot, are base cowards, and no valiant men. By which means, Madet orbis mutuo sanguine, the earth wallows in her own blood,</p><blockquote><p> and which is no less than murder itself; if the same fact be done in public in wars, it is called manhood, and the party is honoured for it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> ———Prosperum et felix scelus,</p></blockquote></div> </div>
